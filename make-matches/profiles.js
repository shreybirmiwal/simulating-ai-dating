    ProfileText: "\ufeffHi!\r\nThis is a dating doc, I\u2019m a 25 year old Swiss man, my native language is French, and\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nBeauty, art, weirdness\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that make me feel intense emotions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is this feeling of awe, like when you\u2019re walking at night in a snowy mountain, the sun still highlighting the horizon from below, and the sky is full of dark clouds, everything is so visually intense and so quiet at the same time. Or more commonly, just laying on the grass, watching this miniature world, with miniature rules, thinking about the life of each strand of grass. Or at a cafe, observing all the elegant patterns of the light going through the glass. Or lizards on a wall, absolutely immobile, and then disappearing in a tiny crack in an instant.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I think that I mostly feel intense emotions through art. Books, movies, series, video games, sometimes paintings, music, check out my list! If I had one choice for each section, I would say:\r\nBook: Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\r\nMovie: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\r\nSeries: Over the Garden Wall\r\nVideo game: Journey\r\nMelancholia works great on me, and generally weird, mysterious, whimsical universes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s weird, it\u2019s better. I\u2019m very much attracted to surprising people, crazy art, and unusual experiences. I hope to experience a large part of the spectrum of non-painful qualias, like eating in complete darkness, drawing with my feet, exploring a cave, standing in an anechoic chamber. But I also like normal stuff, like sunsets and snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nRationality, knowledge\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m very attached to thinking and saying true things, and I get annoyed when people don\u2019t seem to put a lot of value in truth. I aspire to be rational and to not let emotions lead me astray. I also value honesty a lot in relationships. That doesn\u2019t mean I will say things that will harm people just for the sake of it, but I will need a good reason to lie to them when they ask me something. I don\u2019t use honesty as an excuse to not care about the impact of words on the people around me, I understand why people lie sometimes, radical honesty is not always the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowledge rules. The world is fascinating, and I want to know everything. But in practice I\u2019m mostly interested in art, mathematics, sexuality, cognition, and most sciences really. It\u2019s often the case that I get very interested in a topic and I really really want to share it with other people. Sometimes intellectual insights make me jump up and down in excitement (it can also happen with art). I\u2019ll probably try to explain abstract math theorems at some point to you, I cannot help it, if I\u2019m too annoying you can hit me with a broomstick until I flee with the white board.\r\n\r\n\r\nHumans, people, anxiety, connections\r\n\r\n\r\nI often fear that people dislike me and think bad things about me. That\u2019s why I love moments of transcendence of my own head and limitations. When I stop believing that I\u2019m essentially alone and disconnected from other people. When I dance randomly in a room full of other people, and for a moment every thought has disappeared. When I participate in a cuddle puddle. When we\u2019re laying down and watching the stars. When for a moment there\u2019s no ego anymore, and I feel like finally I\u2019m really living a moment with other human beings. I yearn for vulnerable, deep connections. Videos like these make me tear up.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard for me to be socially vulnerable, to express what I feel for other people, if they don\u2019t do it first. I have a fear of rejection. I\u2019m working on it. At the same time, it is easy for me to talk about my emotions as long as they don\u2019t really concern the person I\u2019m talking to. I don\u2019t see emotions as shameful. I\u2019m very attuned to my emotions and know most of the time where my emotions come from.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy gender is male, but I\u2019m not particularly afraid of trying activities or things usually associated with femininity (currently trying pole dance, it\u2019s hard). I get along well with queer people.\r\n\r\n\r\nEthics, positive impact, being a good person\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to have a positive impact on the world. I try to be a good person and a lot of my thoughts are about ethics. I\u2019m deeply concerned about all the suffering happening right now, and at the end of my life, I hope to be proud of all the pain I\u2019ve prevented. I feel a strong duty to help as much as I can.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel a lot of empathy for all animals and I am vegan, and the fact that most of the human population doesn\u2019t care makes me often sad. I have friends who are not vegetarian, but it is hard for me to get really close to someone who still eats other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies, activities\r\n\r\n\r\n* \ud83e\udea8 Sport\r\nI do bouldering each week, and I\u2019m trying other sports (these days, it\u2019s yoga, taekwondo, slackline). I\u2019m also starting to do contemporary dance and pole dance, I want to dance more!\r\n* \ud83c\udfad Theater\r\nI\u2019ve been part of multiple theater groups, I really enjoy acting.\r\n* \ud83d\udef7 Games\r\nPlaying is great, be it board games, theater-like activities, sledding.\r\n* \ud83e\udd13 Nerd stuff\r\nCoding, playing hard puzzle games, reading Wikipedia pages, solving 4D rubik\u2019s cubes, thinking about mathematical or philosophical questions, juggling.\r\n* \u270d\ufe0f Writing\r\nI enjoy writing small stories and journaling, mostly in french.\r\n* \ud83e\udd58 Cooking\r\nI like to try new recipes. Doesn\u2019t always pan out.\r\n\r\n\r\nI drink very little alcohol, I\u2019ve never been drunk and I hope it stays that way. I don\u2019t drink coffee or tea. I could almost say that I haven\u2019t tried any drugs, and I\u2019m definitely not the risk seeking type, but I am interested in trying some psychedelic drugs and seeing weird fractals.\r\n\r\n\r\nRomantic relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nHow am I in a romantic relationship? I\u2019m not entirely sure, I had only one serious romantic relationship in my life. But I am considerate and caring, I enjoy doing small things to make the other person feel loved. I\u2019m very cuddly. I enjoy holding hands. I really dislike fights, and an \u201cintense\u201d relationship with a lot of disputes and reconciliations is not for me. I think I\u2019m good at recognising my mistakes and I haven\u2019t received many complaints of the contrary in my life. Lots of talking about emotions. I hope to do a lot of activities with you, and that we share our hobbies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a relationship, I would prefer not to spend all our free time together, but other than that I\u2019m flexible, especially for a polyamorous relationship. For a monogamous relationship, it would be great to see each other on average at least once a week. I could move to another country if we are a really great fit.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolyamory or closed relationship? I agree with polyamory on principle and find it compelling, but I\u2019ve never been in a polyamorous relationship before, so I\u2019m open to both types of relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious romantic relationships and why they stopped\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I said, I only had one serious romantic relationship in my life, from when I was 16 to 24 years old. We broke up mainly because our values changed, our vision of life was too different. She didn\u2019t want to become vegetarian, and it was very important for her to travel a lot, something I don\u2019t enjoy much. Also probably just the general chemistry diminished with time. We didn\u2019t have a big fight or anything, we still had a lot of affection for each other, and we cooked some pasta together after breaking up. We are still on good terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nComplaints from my previous partner:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Too cold, rational, not particularly in the relationship, but in my vision of the world, of other people, of how the world works\r\n* Sometimes I didn\u2019t give enough attention to her, missed mood signals, because I was too focused on something (that\u2019s fair, when I\u2019m thinking about an abstract problem, it can be hard for me to get back to the real world. It\u2019s hard for me to switch from deep focus to something else quickly)\r\n* I didn\u2019t seem to project myself in the future with her\r\n\r\n\r\nSexuality\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my whole life, I had only 3 different sexual partners, so I would not say that I\u2019m very experienced and I\u2019m still exploring my preferences. I have a medium high sex drive, I\u2019m not very kinky, though I\u2019m open to try new stuff and I\u2019d be happy to discover your kinks. I\u2019m fascinated by human sexuality. If you are asexual, that\u2019s fine as long as you are okay with me having sex with other people.\r\n\r\n\r\nCareer\r\n\r\n\r\nI just  finished my Master\u2019s degree in mathematics in February. I\u2019m not very ambitious when it comes to my career, I\u2019m not particularly interested in climbing up the golden ladder of power in a firm, or founding my own company and getting insanely rich. Most of what makes my life valuable is found outside of a job for me. If there were no pressing problems that need some fixing in the world, I would just aim for an interesting job that would give me enough money to be comfortable and allow me to pursue my little hobbies and side activities in my free time. But the world, as you know, is a mess, so I guess I\u2019ll see what I can do. I\u2019m actively working on what to do career-wise and there are a lot of options, but I also want to put this doc online so I don\u2019t have more information to give you right now.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I look like\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m very thin at 56 kg and 176 cm in height, but I got some muscles from bouldering.\r\n\r\n\r\nMe saying hi to a tree:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMe with a wet butt after sledding:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRehearsing the Mousetrap:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCool bouldering event with black lights and fluorescent paint:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI sound very serious in this document, but in real life I look more like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I find attractive\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m very attracted to bright, curious, bubbly, passionate personalities. Intelligence is hot. I had crushes on people with a lot of different body types in my life, so not an important criterion. I\u2019m mostly attracted to people who present femininely or between feminine and non-binary. I\u2019m at 0.5 on the Kinsey scale. Your age doesn't really matter, as long as you are an adult.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t hesitate to reach out!\r\n\r\n\r\nDeal breakers for me\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll just list things that are possible for someone who would read my description above and still be interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n* You are not almost vegetarian.\r\nExcept if you steal the meat you eat, of course. Also, maybe it\u2019s ok for mussels, because they have a low probability of being sentient? I don\u2019t have a strong opinion on that.\r\n* You have low compassion.\r\n* You want to have kids with me.\r\nIt\u2019s not a problem if you want/have kids with other people. I thought a lot about if I wanted to have kids or not, and I decided to give meaning to my life in other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nTestimonies from friends\r\n\r\n\r\nAsked some friends if they wanted to write something, they had complete freedom, I left everything as it was written.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis guy is a magician when it comes down to curry, he can transform any basic ingredients into the most delicious curry!! - Antoine\r\n(I think Antoine just really likes curry.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGabou, The Gabs, Gabin,\r\nBefore seeing him I always know it will be great because spending time with him doesn\u2019t require any energy, it\u2019s fun, easy, interesting and with lots of hugs haha (I also love hugs oups). It\u2019s a person who I never felt bad asking any questions because even on subjects he knows much better than you (e.g. mathematics) he doesn\u2019t judge (you know there isn\u2019t that small corner smile some people do which make you feel like shit(I hate it)) it feels super natural, and the answer is often helpful (thanks again Gabin for that machine learning class).\r\nEven if he is quite stubborn on some subjects, he (at least from my experience) listens to other people's points of view and tries to understand it (especially if it\u2019s well sourced with rational arguments x)). However, we agree on most things so that must help. Also it\u2019s quite easy to have deep and interesting conversations with him.\r\nI feel like it\u2019s important for Gabin to try to be a better person, and that he can realize his mistakes when he makes some.\r\nThere are plenty of other things but Gabin describes himself better than I do so I will stop here.\r\nHave a nice day/evening/night - Ariane <3\r\n\r\n\r\nA cool kid, faster than light,\r\nSurrender now or face the fight!\r\nA cool kid, shining like a star,\r\nGive it up or taste the war! - Louis",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffIn as many words\r\n\r\n\r\nTo love and be loved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nA deeper understanding and a genuine human connection. \r\n\r\n\r\nA relationship which should last a lifetime, and children, who I would like to see grow old.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit about me\r\n\r\n\r\nI've probably done all of my imbibing, but when I do, I tend to have a cigarette. I don't do drugs. I like walking and running, and I'm thankful for my health. I can drive, but don't. I'll be moving into a home I'll actually own sometime in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm learning to play the piano and hope to become quite proficient at it. I cook a lot, and don't mind vegetables in the slightest. I'm fascinated by physics, yet barely understand. I believe consciousness is a lot like a colour - entirely subjective.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan't survive without music: Floating Points, R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy, Daniel Avery, HAIM, Kelly Lee Owens, HAAi, Ezra Collective, Lee Bong Geun, Mozart.\r\n\r\n\r\nReading: Tom Robbins, David Mitchell, Iain Reid, Phillip K. Dick, Cixin Liu, Haruki Murakami.\r\n\r\n\r\nFilm: Wes Anderson. And his complementary polar, Roy Andersson. Luc Besson, Guillermo del Toro, Coen brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTV: Mad Men, The Office (only seen American), The Good Place, Gogglebox, Big Brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nA woman of the world. Who has a real flair - instruments, languages, knowledge, conversation. Who blossoms rather shies away. An assuredness in herself - and I certainly don't want to be in competition! I'd prefer it if we talked with one another, and that we did this more than we talked about one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot more important than all of that, is a load of love and care.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't exactly had an easy time in this world. I wouldn't want to dwell, but I've missed a lot of the joy and happiness. So to be reminded of such is a real treasure for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit more about me\r\n\r\n\r\nI find it difficult to do some of the social aspects - which everyone else seems to be able to do - such as, to keep on top/point with the collective discussion; or find the relative clause with the fulcrum in a conversation. I'd probably be a bit better at it if there weren't the games, though. I haven't been diagnosed with autism.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a bit of a realist, swaying towards the negative, but idealistic. \u2014 An empire is only in a mind! \u2014 A pensive deliberator, holistic narrator, where the only aim is to make sense and better understand. Physics is literally everything\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nThe funniest part about physics is that it's not magic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not that serious! I flunk every test, simply because I can\u2026 If I'm being told, I need to ask\u2026 I'm about as competitive as a wet sock... \r\n\r\n\r\nI hate conflict, but, even still, I could argue until the end of time - I just don't see the point! I don't hold any deep-seated beliefs - about this, or that. I think it's healthy to formulate an opinion, and especially, to care. I'm tired by the general discourse. Politics is literally everything\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly when humankind brings to an end the endeavour for prosperity, and instead works for the good of humanity, shall we truly prosper and realise wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nOr, as I see it, today...\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen everyone is fooling everyone, everyone is a fool.\r\n\r\n\r\nDreams and aspirations\r\n\r\n\r\nA job is a job for me. When I dream about my ideal home, it'd be supportive and positive. Lots of time for one another.\r\n\r\n\r\nA relationship needs to be tender. I have endless patience, care and concern for the right woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nA side note\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are no more intelligent than, even our earliest ancestors, we simply know more. Our evolution benefits from cooperation, as much as competition, if not more so by cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel, if you spend enough time with a person, you get to know one another, becoming forgiving, inclined, adaptable, agreeable, aligned and assured by them. You grow around one another, in any relationship, community, team, job and life. I'd only hope that we grow together.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffMike\u2019s Date-Me Doc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi, thanks for checking out my date-me doc! My name's Mike, and I'm trying to meet the right person to settle down with. If you think we might be a good match, please send me an email at mikest@udel.edu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic Info\r\n* Age: 31\r\n* Height: 6'0 (183 cm)\r\n* Looking for: Monogamous relationship, interested in women.\r\n* Location: Philadelphia, PA. Open to moving anywhere within the US, but probably not internationally. Open to a long-distance relationship in the short-term, as long as the plan is to eventually settle down in the same location.\r\n* GIANT RED FLAG: I was previously married and it didn\u2019t work out, so we ended it on good terms. Completely understand if this is a dealbreaker for some people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCareer / Hobbies / Interests\r\n* I currently work as a computational biologist at a research lab at UPenn. Basically get paid to work on interesting problems all day, so it's pretty cool. But part of me kinda wants to be building something rather than doing purely academic research, so I may eventually try to switch over to biotech.\r\n* Outside of work, one of my favorite hobbies is teaching. For example:\r\n   * I have an educational Youtube channel with tutorial videos about computational biology and programming.\r\n   * I sometimes teach in-person classes at Fractal University, a cool community-based proto-university in NYC. (I\u2019m also trying to start something similar in the Philly area.) \r\n   * Also, sometimes people ask me to teach Python-for-Biologists workshops, and I'm happy to do this for free. For example, I recently taught a 6-hour virtual workshop for a university in Pakistan that invited me. \r\n   * I\u2019m partly doing this just for fun, but it\u2019s also part of a broader interest in alternative, non-traditional education. I basically agree with all the usual criticisms of the current education system, but I also have this Chesterton\u2019s-fence-esque belief that you shouldn't knock down an institution until you\u2019ve successfully built something better to replace it (which might be harder than it sounds).\r\n* Besides teaching for fun, I also like learning for fun. I especially like to learn how things work from scratch (like neural nets, statistical tests, market economies, compilers, or computers).\r\n* I like a lot of the usual ACX / LessWrong / rationalist stuff, for example:\r\n   * Some public thinkers I find interesting (though don't 100% agree with all the time): Scott Alexander, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Julia Galef, Aella, Dwarkesh Patel, Bryan Caplan, Tyler Cowen, Robin Hanson, Sam Harris\r\n   * Some topics I find interesting: prediction markets, forecasting, machine learning, decision theory, probability brain teasers, meta-science\r\n* Other hobbies: \r\n   * running / fitness\r\n   * watching movies (especially horror / thrillers / mysteries)\r\n   * walking around (could be a hike or exploring a city)\r\n   * weekend roadtrips\r\n   * playing guitar. I used to play saxophone too, and kinda want to get back into that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeliefs and Values\r\n* Political views: Center-right. Classical liberalism, markets, civil liberties, freedom of speech, science, secularism, entrepreneurship, techno-optimism, etc. libertarian-ish, but closer to Tyler Cowen than Ron Paul. \r\n* Religious views: agnostic/atheist, but not hardcore about it. somewhat \"culturally Christian.\" open to raising kids in a religious tradition if it means a lot to you.\r\n* Vegetarian (it's fine if you're not though)\r\n* Things I agree with effective altruists about: malaria prevention, effective giving, animal welfare, etc.\r\n* Things I disagree with effective altruists about: AI risk/benefit\r\n* ^ I try not to be too preachy or argumentative about any of these things, and am certainly open to dating people who don't share these views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout You (Hopefully)\r\n* Someone who\u2019s interested in a serious, monogamous relationship and eventually settling down together. I\u2019m not really looking for casual dating or hookups.\r\n* Someone who\u2019s interested in having kids. Ideally I\u2019d like to have at least 2 kids (because it\u2019s nice to have a sibling), and am open to having more if you\u2019d like.\r\n* Someone who\u2019s kind, gentle, caring, honest.\r\n* ^ I almost wrote \u201cintelligent\u201d here but that\u2019s actually not the right word. Maybe \u201cthoughtful\u201d or \u201ccurious about the world.\u201d I don\u2019t really care how you score on an IQ test, but I\u2019m looking for someone who enjoys learning new things, exploring new ideas, and engaging with different viewpoints in good faith. \r\n* Other than that, I\u2019m not sure what else to write here. Part of me thinks it would be cool to find someone who shares the same interests as me so that we could nerd out together, maybe teach classes together, learn together, work on projects together. But another part of me thinks it would be cool to meet someone completely different from me, like an artist or poet, so that we could share our different worlds with each other.\r\n* If you think we might be a good match, please send me an email at mikest@udel.edu!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Pics\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: this pic is kinda old (2019?). It\u2019s from back when I used to be in the Coast Guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to see more of what I look like, there are a bunch of videos of me on Youtube",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffBrad Levin\u2019s Dating Profile[1]\r\nLast updated: Feb 2025\r\nAbout Me\r\nBasics\r\nI\u2019m a straight man, poly, 41, living in Sunnyvale, California, half the time with my 7 and 8 year-old children and the other half solo.\r\nWork\r\nI\u2019m a product manager at Google in HR information systems, been there for 8 years; Yahoo and Silicon Valley Bank before that (check out LinkedIn for my deets).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nA few selections from recent years; more on Facebook. \r\nWhy date me?\r\n-Friends describe me as caring, a good listener, energetic, creative, fun, supportive, and reliable \r\n-Romantic partners have mentioned touch and my proactive communication about tough/vulnerable issues\r\n-Values alignment if effective altruism, fitness, family, and lifelong learning are important to you\r\n-We could go to musicals, concerts, performances, conferences, and travel together\r\nDating partner must haves\r\n-Bay area-local\r\n-Female\r\n-------------------------------------- Nice-to-haves section -------------------------------------- \r\nIf basics are enough for you, stop reading now and skip to the Connect with Me section below. If not, feel free to peruse these nice-to-haves: I\u2019m sharing so the particularly curious have a more informed idea of me as a potential dating partner.\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\r\nI\u2019m mostly looking for a primary partner, but am open to other structures.  You can find more detail on my OKC and Plura profiles; including excerpts below. \r\nAlso: what I want may change! I\u2019m open to the possibility of meeting someone great who has in mind a different type of relationship. I also recognize people often don\u2019t know exactly what they want in a relationship, including me. \r\nChildren\r\nI don\u2019t want to father additional children, but am open to dating a woman who already has them. \r\nI\u2019m open to a long-term romantic partner taking an active role in my children\u2019s lives, but I\u2019m not seeking that involvement (I\u2019ve been divorced several years and my parenting status quo is working well). \r\nDating radius\r\nIt's so juicy when the two people dating are proximal! Since I'm not willing to drive farther, I try hard to date folks who live within 20 or so minutes from me in Sunnyvale (or have an unusual situation, e.g. work nearby or don't mind driving to my place disproportionately).\r\nAge\r\n28\u201349 years old (though this isn\u2019t a strict range)\r\nLiving together\r\nI\u2019m open to and interested in cohabitating with a primary partner, but that\u2019s not a dealbreaker. \r\nOutdoors\r\nMy favorite outdoor activity is tennis, though I also love swimming and frisbee and basketball and frequently run, walk, kayak, and hike outdoors.\r\nBooks\r\nCurrently reading:\r\n-Untamed by Glennon Doyle\r\n-Polysecure by Jessica Fern\r\n-What we owe the future, by William MacAskill\r\nMore Details\r\nPeople close to me have recognized that I\u2019m especially: (i) curious\u2014about the big picture and systems and ideas, (ii) highly organized, (iii) trustworthy, and (iv) sensitive. Myers-Briggs from years ago): ENTJ. Top 5 CliftonStrengths: Harmony, Discipline, Learner, Consistency, Achiever.\r\n\ud83d\udea9Red flags for primary partners \ud83d\udea9:\r\n1. Pseudoscientific beliefs, e.g. in astrology, manifesting, crystals, non-physics \u201cenergy\u201d\r\n2. Criticize often \r\n3. Perennially late and forgetful\r\nWhat\u2019s most important to me; unlikely to change:\r\n* My commitment to parenting\r\n* Involvement in effective altruism (since 2011)\r\n* Staying healthy, e.g. through regular exercise, decent diet, and taking mental health seriously\r\n* Social involvement , e.g. hosting events with friends and community\r\n* Non-religious\r\n* Intellectual pursuits: consuming and discussing podcasts, books, articles, and news\r\nIdeal partner\r\nI completed a relationship workshop that resulted in clarity about what I'm curious/interested (but not in any way expecting) to experience in an anchor romantic partnership. I'll list below some of that clarity; however, due to some feedback I received from a couple female friends, I've now updated this intro paragraph to make sure nobody reads the below as a list of requirements or expectations of a potential partner (which it is definitely not). Please consider the below as predilections and preferences, rather than a checklist of must-haves!\r\nA) Acceptance of my non-monogamy.\r\nFor me to feel like I fully belong in the relationship, I've learned it's critical that my partner openly accepts me having multiple simultaneous romantic relationships, and that I retain the autonomy to pursue new ones.\r\nB) Attraction/chemistry.\r\nI am huge into touch, value sleeping together (in the literal sense), and love doing erotic stuff.\r\nC) Perception that we're close peers.\r\nThis one took a lot of work to develop/unwind/discover in the workshop, and though I've learned it's important for me I'm still not yet sure why. In any case, what does \"close peers\" mean for me? Here's my best articulation, in five points; many of the examples derive from experiences in my own life and illustrate similar life experiences or attributes I seek in a partner.\r\n\"Close peer\" #1: Overachiever. Doesn't much matter in what domain - maybe you're an elite gamer, or excel in fitness classes, or a director where you work, or finished your doctorate while founding a company, or pioneered a popular new form of tarot card therapy (yes I've encountered that latter \ud83e\udd23).\r\n\"Close peer\" #2: Leader. This might look like you teaching the class, running the workshop, organizing the campaign, driving the process change. Or that you lead by following, e.g. influencing others to put a full effort into the workout, modeling an innovative collaborative learning approach in the classroom that other students adopt, taking the meditation lesson to heart, signing the Giving Pledge and posting it in your house for others to follow.\r\n\"Close peer\" #3: Wild. The freedom and power that comes from intentionally breaking a significant social rule, then thriving afterward. Perhaps you left a religion, risked your education by standing up for something unpopular, exited monogamy, or something comparably high-stakes that risked enduring family or social rejection or job loss.\r\n\"Close peer\" #4: Seasoned. The maturity that comes from enduring a few hard knocks. Maybe you grew up in a household that lacked food security, or your baby died, or you weathered a disability you found difficult, or a parent neglected you.\r\n\"Close peer\" #5: Mentally healthy. You regularly have more spoons than you need to make it through the day, and are more often than not positive and open and emotionally available.\r\n-Someone recently asked me to describe \"my tribe.\" I haven't found mine yet: but an overachieving altruist that wants to overachievingly altruist a bit harder as a result of their primary relationship, sounds like a kindred spirit to me.\r\nExpectations\r\n-I've learned that I expect roughly equal participation when it comes to the work of initiating, planning, and organizing. That means voicing the time and place and activity of proposed dates, initiating touch, proposing dinner plans, etc. should be shared roughly equally (rather than the male doing the disproportionate labor in these areas, as is the norm in heterosexual dating). This also applies to the vulnerable work of initiating the relationship conversations that are needed for a healthy relationship.\r\n-I've also learned that my communication style merits calling out, since I have a particular approach that I've found perturbs some, while prompting others to offer kudos. My approach is this: I try to match the communication mode to the importance of the subject. To illustrate, let's say you're texting me with concerns about where we ate dinner last night. I will try to elevate the mode of communication to something real-time such as a phone call, video chat, or in-person discussion. I might even (gasp!) call you in response to your text.\r\nIn general, the more that feelings are involved or the stakes are high, the more I'll advocate to elevate the mode of communication (text < call < vid chat < in person). My reasoning is: the communication modes higher up the chain offer richer understanding since they include some or all of tone, pace, the opportunity to clarify, more words, pauses (and their absence), facial cues, and the accountability of a real-time conversation. This means fewer assumptions and more information, which I believe improves the odds of the desired twins of communication: (1) understanding and (2) being understood.\r\nThe downside is this approach requires hopping on a call, which some find less comfortable than texting, and can require a modicum of scheduling or driving to the partner, which texting doesn't. Know that for subjects like relationship status and where concerns are involved, I expect the conversation to be real-time, and I will engage using that mode where feasible.\r\nConnect With Me\r\nIf you\u2019d like to get to know me better or just have something to say to me after reading this, feel free to Facebook message or email me.\r\nShare With Someone\r\nLink to share easily: bit.ly/dateBrad\r\n________________\r\n[1] A hat tip to Gina, whose bit.ly/dategina provided much of the structure and ideas you see above (used w/permission).

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHello Internet!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Julie. I\u2019m 39 years old (which honestly feels very old to type and not representative of how old I feel at all!). I moved to Sacramento a few years ago by way of Brooklyn and San Francisco before then. I have a 4 year old dog named Bailey (see pictures below). I work remotely for a startup in NYC where I am the Director of People Operations (like a more fun version of saying \u201cHR.\u201d) All of my immediate family lives here in Sac and I am really enjoying being close to them after years of living further away. This picture is of my sister (on the right) and I (in black on the left).  \r\n\r\n\r\nI am very happy and have a full life with deep relationships with my family members, long time friends, and colleagues, all who enrich my life. My friends and family would describe me as smart, funny, warm, deeply empathetic, and cheerful. I am very independent and am not creating this doc because I desperately need a man. I am here because I\u2019d like to find someone who will bring something to our relationship -- and I will do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a democrat. I would like to date someone who shares similar political views. I don\u2019t have children, and am not interested in having children, although I am more than fine dating someone who does have kids. I am a very proud auntie to several of my friend\u2019s children. I\u2019m godmother to my cousin\u2019s son. \r\n  \r\n\r\nI travel a fair amount for either work or fun. My most recent international travel has been: India, Switzerland, and Mexico. (Picture is me with my friends/coworkers at a wedding in Mexico)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor fun, I enjoy hanging out with my dog, going on walks in new areas, and taking her to training classes. She may be 4, but she is stubborn! I enjoy going to trivia nights, trying new restaurants, watching classic movies, long walks, exploring new places, exercise, baseball games, bowling, cooking/baking, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeal Breakers for me and/or you:\r\n* I don\u2019t smoke, and wouldn\u2019t be compatible with a smoker.   \r\n* I drink occasionally, but not very much. \r\n* I work what I call \u201cLazy east coast hours\u201d meaning I start work between 6 and 7 am. As a result, I don\u2019t stay out late, and I'm in bed early. \r\n* I don\u2019t drink coffee, but love the bliss tea at Temple. \r\n* I am not active or addicted to social media. I have an instagram that I have not posted on since circa 2019. I don\u2019t have tiktok. I\u2019m not influencing anything. \r\n* I spend most of my day working in front of the computer and don\u2019t like to spend my time outside of work on my computer or phone. As a result, I am not the kind of person who texts back immediately. I get to it when I have time, unless of course it\u2019s urgent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for:\r\n   * A man in a similar age range (probably 35-50) who\u2019s looking to meet another person and really get to know her - ie, you\u2019re dating with the intention of finding \u201cyour person.\u201d  \r\n   * A man who\u2019s passionate/enthusiastic about life.\r\n   * Someone who\u2019s career driven\r\n   * Doesn\u2019t smoke\r\n   * Not a heavy drinker\r\n   * Not a big partier (aren\u2019t those days behind us?)\r\n   * Someone who cares about family\r\n   * Low ego/humble\r\n   * Kind\r\n   * Patient\r\n\r\n\r\nSound like you?

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate Me - Ja\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone inspired me to write this.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt feels strange writing something like this for strangers to read, but it\u2019s a bit better than a dating profile that lacks so much information and results in perhaps not the best decision making.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find any of this a tad interesting then please reach out and perhaps we can get to know each other in person.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis doc is a work in progress\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGender: Male\r\nLocation: Watford, UK\r\nYear of birth: 1987\r\nHeight: 5ft 9\r\nEthnicity: East Asian\r\nSexual orientation: Straight - looking for a woman\r\nLocation: London, UK\r\nLanguages: English, Mandarin\r\nAttachment style : Fairly secure, tendency to be anxious.\r\nLove languages: Favourites are acts of service, physical touch, quality time. But to be fair, I respond well to all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born in China and moved to the UK when I was little.\r\nWe moved around a few times in my childhood and I\u2019d say it shaped me quite a lot. There are positives and negatives to this and I feel that slowly I\u2019m experiencing more of the positives than I did as a child and young adult.\r\nAll of my education has been in the UK so I\u2019m quite a mix of cultures, but I see that as an adult I\u2019m probably more British (if I had to lean a particular way) than Chinese given my environment and social group. With that said, I always felt a bit of an outsider - quite introverted, very different home life compared to my peers at school, one life at home and a completely different life outside of home - things felt a bit disjointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife situation:\r\n* I work in marketing and recently went freelance (again) - it\u2019s busy - I work from home\r\n* I\u2019m a homeowner (and recent cat owner - yes, she\u2019s very cute, and yes she\u2019s occasionally a menace)\r\n* I can drive and have a car\r\n* I can get into all of central London in less than an hour\r\n* I don\u2019t smoke or take drugs - I tend to be a minimalist when it comes to \r\n* I only drink socially and occasionally - recently I\u2019ve been not drinking at all due to a meditation programme I\u2019m preparing for (March 2025)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m like\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat inspires me\r\n* People who care about others\r\n* People who work for something greater than themselves\r\n* People who are willing to surrender to life and allow\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not saying I aspire to be all of these things, but they certainly inspire me\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I enjoy\r\n* One-on-one conversations with my friends, and the occasional stranger.\r\n* Cooking and eating - especially if other people are involved.\r\n* Going on hikes, cycling, camping, going up mountains, road trips, natural environments.\r\n* I love the Scottish Highland, and Edinburgh (very happy childhood memories).\r\n* I\u2019ve recently rehomed a cat called Mura - she\u2019s cute and an occasional menace. So, now I\u2019m a cat person in the making. I had a hamster as a kid but it didn\u2019t really like me and I wasn\u2019t too fond of him either so that doesn\u2019t really count.  \r\n* I enjoy conversations about the future, technology, life, what we\u2019ve learnt about ourselves, other people\u2019s stories.        \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy personality (at least my blind-spot ridden perspective of it)\r\n   * Ambivert - quite happy in my own space in peace and quiet, but totally down for being sociable with the right crowd. I tend to be quiet rather than needing to be vocal by default.\r\n   * I\u2019m very close to a handful of friends. I feel blessed to have such friends and they are like family to me.\r\n   * I don\u2019t enjoy small talk most of the time but when it\u2019s about getting to know someone new then it can be fun too to begin with.\r\n   * I\u2019m a dreamer. Perhaps I\u2019m ADHD - I\u2019m not sure. I daydream all the time (perhaps very compulsively) about everything. Business ideas, people and relationships, ways to improve the NHS, why my cat behaves the way she does, what a conversation meant several years ago, whether we can have a viable economy based on currency that has another dimension of value attached to it, about meditation and yoga practices, about the nature of birth and death, how people grow and develop, about why my circuit breaker tripped for several days but is now back up and working perfectly fine, if a curry sauce filled tofu ball would be good bit of food, \u2026\r\n   * I\u2019d say I\u2019m quite spiritual but not in the usual sense of the word. I\u2019m highly logical with an open mind. I don\u2019t have beliefs. I\u2019m purely in this life, with this body, with very limited perception of reality. But it is growing and I leave the door open.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValues\r\n   * Open-mindedness - to me this means not being bought into anything. Staying open to being shown something new or contrary to current perspective.\r\n   * Continuing to grow in awareness\r\n   * Moving towards doing what\u2019s more right and relevant for the world - this is not to say do not respect personal wants, but just recognising that personal desires tend to be formed by the world we reside in and they are highly transient - and it relates to the point above. With growing awareness I recognise that my desires are a consequence of my physiology, emotions, and memories - and as I become more conscious in my actions then the interactions of those elements also change. So, my desires change when my consciousness changes. Moving towards choice of desire from compulsive desires.\r\n   * Rightness is debatable\r\n   * Authenticity - I do feel that everyone is already authentic, there is nothing about a being that isn\u2019t - your actions and thoughts are not someone else's. I mean in the sense that we move towards growing awareness and express ourselves by our choice rather than by our compulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want in a relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have a companion to travel through life with.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone to share with\r\n   * Food - I enjoy eating together, tasting new dishes (especially desserts )\r\n   * Maybe some hobbies and projects - but not a dealbreaker\r\n   * A home\r\n   * Ideas and thoughts\r\n   * What else?\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone to learn from and learn with.\r\n   * Intellectual curiosity - talking about concepts, situations, the future, history and bouncing ideas feels important to me.\r\n   * A drop of spiritual curiosity - some amount of thirst to know more of life, consciousness and what we/I don\u2019t know.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who really wants me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone I really want to be with.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully, someone to have children with. So ideally aged between 25 and 35. But I\u2019m not going to be strict on this - it\u2019s just what seems to make sense given that desire.\r\nBut with that said, I\u2019d rather live a happy life than have kids at great cost to wellbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical, emotional, and sexual intimacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe utmost mutual trust that we\u2019re in this together. Being on the same team.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalling out bullshit and being able to step in when needed. Not letting undesirable things just happen without being addressed. Again, same team - doing this together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQualities that I find attractive in a partner\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Feminine confidence\r\n   * Gentle temperament but not meekness\r\n   * Able to go with the flow as well as being adamant when needed\r\n   * A curiosity for life's mysteries\r\n   * Wittiness\r\n   * Intellectual intelligence to an extent\r\n   * Low maintenance and easy going nature - but still with a bit of fire\r\n   * Straightforwardness\r\n   * Adaptability (I may be projecting a bit here)\r\n   * Groundedness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome boundaries\r\n\r\n\r\nLong distance relationship - it\u2019s a no for me. A LTR doesn\u2019t feel real to me and seems like a dream life not real life. I know it can work for many people, but I don\u2019t feel this is the situation I\u2019d thrive in.\r\nPerhaps later on if there needs to be some distance due to short term work, looking after parents, etc then that\u2019s fine - just doesn\u2019t seem right to begin with.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like communication to be straightforward with no game playing. Don\u2019t make it harder than it needs to be. I truly feel there are much better ways to use our energy than playing around with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we could have together\r\n   * A warm loving home and family where we nurture each other.\r\n   * Deep mutual trust that we are here for each other.\r\n   * Great intimacy - physically, emotionally, sexually, and any other way that comes to mind.\r\n   * Financial security and freedom - we can work on this together. So that we can pursue things other than careers and money motivated endeavours - do things that are more alive.\r\n   * Support each other in our pursuits. Even have some things that we pursue together.\r\n   * Have kids and grow into wonderful guides for them as they grow.\r\n   * Each of us puts effort into being the best for the other - then there will be no getting bored, things going stale, the flame dying out. Selfishly selfless route to endless passion and energy.\r\n   * Share in the responsibilities of life and home. As equally as possible. Recognising that it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the physical actions are completely equal. But we do what\u2019s needed.\r\n   * A really fun time and fun life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all that said, that is my brain dump for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s meet!\r\n\r\n\r\njyue87 [at] gmail [dot] com",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffJonathan - Date me doc\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm 36, a reformed Baptist who holds to the 1689 LBCF. I'm looking for a Christian lady who desires to be a wife, mother, and help build and beautify the house that I own for the glory of God. God has blessed me financially where I am effectively retired now and manage my investments. I'd love to find a lady who desires to be a wife and help raise a family. My goals as a future husband are to help lead, and love my wife as myself, help build a large family (Lord willing), and help my church in any way I can. I know the husband's duty is to love his wife as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt my church I volunteer with the Food Pantry ministry and the audio/tech booth. I attend Silicon Valley Reformed Baptist church in Sunnyvale, CA. You can check out our youtube channel! Also I would recommend checking out \u201cThe Bible Bashed Podcast\u201d as it has been greatly influential in my life. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf a match seems like a possibility I'm eager to go out and meet you! I am not looking to relocate but focusing on preparing my home for marriage (which I own) as Christ is preparing a place for us in the future. Also I am very eager to involve pastoral counsel early on to help guide the man and woman to see if this would be a good fit for marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy current interests are weightlifting, learning how to do handyman repairs around the house, and listening to Christian podcasts. \r\n\r\n\r\nNice to meet you!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n(Sun was in my eyes)",

I'm on the market, and if you're looking at this, then I guess you are too. This should help us navigate those awkward first steps.\nI'm looking for someone to live and love with long-term while we both support each other's goals. I've never been married and while I'd be happy with a lifetime partner, I don't know that marriage itself is the right setup for me. That said, I have been in a 5+ year relationship. In the meantime, let's just be nice to each other and test our compatibility. We can see if there's an intersect in what we're looking for and do what seems right in the meantime.\nMy ideal partner has obsessions and can't help but share them. She has clear goals and a plan to achieve them, even if they're hard as hell. (I'm talking to you, ambitious women other guys are afraid of.) She takes care of herself now, knowing our bodies get harder to maintain as we age. Also, no kids, religion, or perpetuating animal suffering through food choices. She has her own obsessions and wants to make a positive mark on the world.\nI take on challenging goals. I'm mostly through the manuscript of a nonfiction book on a technical topic. I've published in both academic journals and popular media. I've also grown two nonprofits from scratch. I set up the org and funding mechanism that helped a long-active male contraceptive to a Phase I human clinical trial. I also facilitated campaigns to get a better voting method implemented in two cities, which had never been used in government elections before. I've raised millions of dollars for causes I care about. I enjoy being active and have a ton of different hobbies.\nLocation-wise, I can live anywhere for my work and recently chose Philadelphia after referencing a simple heat table I put together factoring in cost of living, walkability, transit, and bikability. I actively do not like cars and choose not to own one. I do have a license and can drive though. I have to do this visiting Kentucky during the holidays.\nOther randomness. I care about financial independence. I budget for charitable giving and give publicly. I also love science and am rather methodical at most things I try my hand at. If you\u2019re as obsessed with learning, we\u2019ll probably get along great. Also, I try my best for clarity on all this, but if you're still nicking a particular box and things look otherwise good, I'd still be up for us talking and checking things out.\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\nSeeking\n24\nSex\nFemale\n25\nRelationship Type\nMonogomous\n26\nDating For\nLong-term relationship, life partner\n27\n28\n29\nAt a chess tournament with a friend.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffJanuary 2025\r\nAbout me\r\nI am 23, I live in Oxford, studied in my native Australia, and grew up mainly in India.[1] I feel moved by the plight of current people and non-human animals, but also find persuasive the basic longtermist argument that the future is big and important and changeable. So for now I am trying to help make the transition to AGI go well.\r\nYou can see some things about me on various places online, including the EA Forum, LinkedIn, Goodreads, Google Scholar, and my Substack subscriptions.\r\nThat is fairly cold and impersonal; it is perhaps more fun and interesting to get to know each other by talking. But for now, here are some less work-y things about me:\r\n* I like to read, play board games and ~any sport, hike and camp, talk about philosophy and physics and photosynthesis and occasionally non-alliterating things.\r\n* I am very honest and value open, frank, fairly direct communication with others. I tend to ask quite a few questions, mainly because I am curious to learn about other people\u2019s experiences and ideas!\r\n* I am not very artsy; beyond the occasional poem (e.g. here, here), and some elegant mathematising if that counts, my creative output is meagre.\r\n* I have rather little familiarity with pop culture and I mostly do not regret this. But it means I wouldn\u2019t be a very good conversationalist on such things.\r\nHere are some photos of me doing things I like. And this is what my[2] face looks like:\r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout you\r\nApart from demographic things (I have only ever been attracted to women, this seems very unlikely to change; being a somewhat similar age/life stage is helpful) and unsurprising things (one\u2019s partner being kind and clever and caring and calm and courageous is always nice) I would like to be with someone who is:\r\n* Morally serious - the stakes are high; there is so much to protect; doing the right thing matters. I think I would struggle to deeply empathise with and respect someone who had a more blas\u00e9 attitude to improving the world. It seems less important what exactly you care about and want to work on.[3]\r\n* Intellectually curious - talking about ideas is quite important to me, and it would be hard to spend lots of quality time with someone who isn\u2019t interested in ideas. But what you study/studied, who your favourite philosophers are, what your favourite theorem is etc is less important.\r\nBeyond that, of course, it would be nice if we enjoyed some of the same activities, but I feel like that is more malleable.\r\nIt would clearly be nice to live near each other, but I am open to exploring a relationship with someone who currently lives far away.[4]\r\nI am open to ~any preference on whether to have kids, I have quite mixed thoughts.[5]\r\nYou can email me at oscardelaney0@gmail.com.\r\n________________\r\n[1] My parents were doing \u2018global health and development\u2019 work before it was cool in EA ;)\r\n[2] Is my past self really \u2018me\u2019? What is the relationship between \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018my face\u2019? Tricky questions!\r\n[3] I care quite a bit about EA as a project, and somewhat about EA as a community. It might be helpful if you do too, but I think the \u2018morally serious\u2019 frame of mind is the more important part.\r\n[4] I quite like living in Oxford, but would be open to moving for the right (work or romantic!) opportunity.\r\n[5] I like spending time with kids and would all else equal prefer to be a parent (and am generally pro-natalist!). But all else isn\u2019t equal, e.g. if AGI comes this decade it could be a very tumultuous few years where I want to focus fairly hard on work without caring for young kids. But I don\u2019t know.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffEmail: tom.arrow42@gmail.com\r\nTom Keith\r\n\r\n\r\nMe\r\nWhy am I single?  \r\n* My work life (sea below) has taken me out of the country for significant periods. \r\n* I used to be quite insecure about expressing romantic attraction, although this has been largely worked through.\r\n* My face is not very expressive, and I seem much colder than I actually am to a lot of people. I convey strong emotion much more with verbal explanation than any visual cue.\r\n* For serious relationships, my standards are very high. \r\n\r\n\r\nBasic info\r\n* 5\u20198\u201d/173cm   \r\n* Straight\r\n* Ideally looking for a monogamous relationship, but open to polyamorous casual dating\r\n* Want children in 5-15 years, but I don\u2019t think this is a dealbreaker\r\n* Muscular build, lean but not shredded\r\n* Atheist\r\n* 27 years old, British\r\n* Non-smoker, rarely drink but not teetotal\r\n* First class Chemistry degree\r\n* Working week in Portsmouth, with travel abroad\r\n* Weekends in Glasgow and London\r\n* Vegan\r\n* \u00a350k salary, own a flat in Glasgow with a small mortgage\r\n* Highly extraverted\r\n* Main love language is physical touch, followed by quality time\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies and interests  \r\nMy two main hobbies are my fitness, which is extremely important to me, and Warhammer. Painting the miniatures and playing the game with friends is a major way I unwind. Here\u2019s a few exercise achievements I am most proud of:\r\n\r\n   * Can do 6-10 muscle ups as standard, with a PB of 12\r\n   * Similar scores for one-arm press ups\r\n   * 100-120kg bench press\r\n   * Run a mile and a half (2.4km) in comfortably under 10 minutes\r\n\r\n\r\nI have dabbled in a large number of other activities, with the following being my current side-quests:\r\n   * Archery (specifically speed-shooting with a horsebow)\r\n   * Vegan cooking\r\n   * Hiking (especially Munro bagging)\r\n   * Organising social events\r\n   * Stand up comedy (but mainly while travelling)\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond this, I am generally open to giving other people\u2019s interests a go, at least once. \r\n\r\n\r\nWork life\r\n[Redacted] Feel free to enquire.\r\n  \r\n\r\nCharacter traits\r\n   * Discipline, drive, and executive function\r\n   * Very low in neuroticism and anxiety, with a stable mood (I\u2019ve got graphs lol)\r\n   * Regrettably low in curiosity  \r\n   * Direct style of communication\r\n   * Hard to offend\r\n   * Aside from a few skeletal anomalies that haven\u2019t meaningfully limited me, I have excellent health (as do most of my family)\r\n   * Probably too invested in some kind of general protagonist identity, and working on being warmer and more human\r\n   * Filter out most sensory experience, can go months without noticing a thing in my environment if I don\u2019t need to pay attention to it\r\n      * Appreciate this is not the case for everyone and have experience maintaining a relationship with a partner that is very affected by sensory input\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily routines\r\n      * I am more of a morning person; staying up late into the night without good reason is not a thing for me\r\n      * I reach full alertness and energy shortly after getting up\r\n      * I rarely suffer from low energy, in any sense, and nap only infrequently\r\n      * This is predicated on my daily rhythm giving me good sleep and nourishing food, I absolutely crash without these\r\n      * My meals are very big, and I hardly snack. \r\n      * I abhor \u201ckilling time\u201d at home, and prefer to spend time intentionally. This most frequently comes up in relationships around partners wanting to spend lots of time watching TV/film. If you want me to do this, it\u2019s best to sell me on why that show in particular is worth a deliberate decision to watch it. Just putting something on as a low-effort way to spend an evening will not fly. \r\n      * Work out 3 days on, 1 day off\r\n      * Each night I record what I did that day in a \u201cMemory Book\u201d and have every single day for 7 years. Be prepared to feature!  \r\n\r\n\r\nRomance & the Bedroom  \r\n         * Preference for leaning into dominant roles, although I am pretty vanilla at heart\r\n         * Limited experience with kink but open to exploration, with communication\r\n         * High libido and I actively want near-daily sex but desire to go for multiple rounds can be greatly hampered by not having eaten enough or physical tiredness\r\n         * You\u2019ll generally get a lot more out of me by starting early in the evening, or earlier in the day with a coffee\r\n         * *friends mocking me for going to the Roomba recharge station*\r\n         * I have embraced using sex toys on partners, but don\u2019t feel excited about them being used on me (this could be discussed further)\r\n         * Thoroughly enjoy giving head and partners reaching orgasm\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve had one relationship lasting a year, a handful of four month relationships and a fair number of short-term flings or one-off encounters. I\u2019m in touch and on good terms with many of these people, and don\u2019t hold grudges with any. None of these were \u201cbad break ups\u201d, and I have never fought with a romantic partner. My longest relationship was polyamorous for the second half. I feel we made this work and it is something I could continue doing. That being said, it came with costs that at present I would prefer not to pay in a long-term relationship. If you\u2019re poly and otherwise think we could be a match, please don\u2019t rule it out on these grounds!\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to take relationships quickly and am comfortable living together earlier than most, I think. As I grow close with people, I can become an absolute Snuggle Bear but this is dependent on chemistry. A friend with benefits, who I cherish but do not feel this chemistry with, instead describes me as a \u201cRoomba\u201d...\r\n\r\n\r\nFun facts  \r\n         * Can do sin(x) functions in my head, and could teach you how\r\n         * Made Richard Dawkins laugh\r\n         * Estimated to eat 92.3kg of houmous per year\r\n         * Exchanged typewritten letters with a romantic interest whose name I never knew through unsuspecting Berlin baristas\r\n         * Once performed in a live theatrical production of \u201cThe Nightman Cometh\u201d\r\n         * Appeared in the New York Times, and on a BBC documentary\r\n\r\n\r\nYou\r\nBasic info\r\nThere are very few unequivocal green and red flags for me, and many different ways I can be attracted to a person. Most of my red flags are fairly common: jealous, controlling, unable to accept they are at fault, boring. The ones more specific to me are:\r\n         * Actively religious or superstitious\r\n         * Not vegan and unwilling to discuss my ethics on this with an open-mind\r\n         * Significant lack of interest in their health, fitness, and longevity\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are nice-to-haves:  \r\n         * Black hair\r\n         * Tanned/dark skin\r\n         * Large breasts \r\n         * Muscular/athletic figure\r\n         * Confidence and assertiveness\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the lack of these are dealbreakers for long-term relationships:\r\n         * Self-initiated passion projects, ideally nerdy ones\r\n         * Clear and open communication styles \r\n         * Aged 20-33\r\n  \r\n\r\nWork life\r\nI want to date people who impress me, and a big part of that will usually come from their career goals. Ambition is helpful, but at a minimum I want a partner to know who they are and what they are working towards. The minutiae of this are not so important to me and there\u2019s very few professions that constitute red flags. Essentially, I want to be impressed by a woman\u2019s grit. Tell me how hard you\u2019ve worked and what you can overcome! \r\n\r\n\r\nFinances  \r\nI\u2019d like to think I am generous with friends and partners, and recognise that there are (dwindling) expectations on a man to spend money on a woman. That being said, I am far more excited to date someone who sees being a homeowner as a signal of good financial security and executive function than someone trying to marry rich. I intend to donate too much money for that to ever pay off. With that said, I don\u2019t have any expectations for a partner\u2019s income or financial situation provided that they can take care of themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bedroom\r\nI would like for a partner to be of a similarly high sex-drive and be committed to this remaining an exciting activity. Ideally, the middle of the afternoon, or an empty field in the summer, would be a perfectly acceptable opportunity to get it on. There\u2019s not much more of a filter I want to apply here, the rest can be figured out with dating. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you feel like we could be match, feel free to reach out by email!",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffOverview\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tI\u2019m building a life of impact, intellectual curiosity, physical activity, and a growth orientation. I\u2019d like a partner who values and shares these areas, if not the specifics in each area. I can seem hard on the outside, but I\u2019m a romantic and I promise that there\u2019s a warm, soft core.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nHere\u2019s how excited I can get about ideas! (Very old.)\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nIn a castle in Spain, after picking a padlock to get there.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nI accidentally got a cat during covid. I\u2019m lucky to have a lot of friends who look after her when I\u2019m traveling.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nNot my child. But isn\u2019t she cute?\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe basics\r\n* Male, age 44, seeking female, age approximately 35 to late 40s, for a monogamous relationship akin to (or actually) marriage.\r\n* I live in San Francisco. More below.\r\n* I don\u2019t need to have children. I\u2019d be excited about it with the right person, in specific situations. See below.\r\n* Email: m@redheron.com\r\n* Facebook profile. I don\u2019t post much, and less publicly, but you can see mutual friends at least. Twitter. I don\u2019t post much there either. It\u2019s a bit out of date, but you can also find me on OkCupid.\r\nMore detail\r\nImpact\r\n* I\u2019m involved in nuclear fusion, because I believe that the world needs clean, cheap, abundant, safe energy in order to limit climate change and create abundance.\r\n* I\u2019m passionate about structural improvements to our governance systems. I\u2019m also working on a software project (writeup) to help people vote faster, with more information.\r\n* I spend a lot of my time on another software project -- a collaborative note taker, task manager, etc. (That sounds boring, but I promise that it\u2019s not!)\r\nIntellectual curiosity\r\n* I love discussing things that we\u2019ve read or heard, or pondering how something works, or listening to/watching something together and trying to figure it out. I especially love finding people who are experts in some random field but are patient enough to let me question them about what they are doing, why it makes sense and how it works. I especially especially love tag-teaming this quizzing with a friend.\r\nPhysical activity\r\n* I run, ski, back-country ski, snow camp, backpack and mountain bike. At the moment I\u2019m working on running further. Have you thought about how far one can run in a day, and how much further it is than we can backpack?! Imagine setting up a base camp in a national park somewhere and then running all over the place for a few days. You could see so much!\r\n* I\u2019m totally excited to try your sports. These are just the ones that I\u2019ve gotten sucked into so far.\r\n* I\u2019d like to learn to dance. I\u2019m pretty terrible at it, and cuban salsa did not go well, even after a year of trying. The next experiment is fusion (dance, not energy, in this case).\r\n* I\u2019ve done a lot of urban exploration. I don\u2019t do as much now, but I\u2019ve picked every lock in the Conservatory Flowers in Golden Gate Park and I still love climbing cranes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowth orientation\r\n* I\u2019m not in coaching or therapy at the moment, but I\u2019ve gotten a ton from coaching in the past.\r\n* I\u2019m all over the various growth books and recently read Good Inside and The Courage to be Disliked.\r\n* I strive to improve my close relationships and bring my best self to them; and to take feedback gratefully.\r\n* Don\u2019t confuse this for woo. I\u2019m a rational atheist who wants to take the good stuff from the touchy-feely hippies, but also keeps discovering that they have more good stuff than I thought. (Who knew that blindfolded contact improv could be so much fun?)\r\nSampling of things that I like talking about\r\n* The world\r\n   * What's the right way to address climate change? And population growth?\r\n   * If you could change something about how American democracy works, what would it be? Is western democracy on a decline? How can we fix it? (I think that America may be on the verge of what I call the \u201cNew American Consensus\u201d, and with it an era of great accomplishments.)\r\n* Tech\r\n   * What would I do if I had good VR/AR hardware?\r\n   * How can software be better? How can we build it better? What would a debugger designed for functional programming look like? (IMO: very different, and very awesome.)\r\n   * How can we collaborate more effectively?\r\n   * How will the world change when SpaceX gets Starship working?\r\n* Other\r\n   * How can I be kinder, warmer and gentler, but still help groups to get things done?\r\n   * How can I get into somewhere I shouldn\u2019t?\r\n   * How can I travel with less gear?\r\nWhere I live\r\n* I live in San Francisco.\r\n* I\u2019ve been here for nearly 25 years and know a lot of wonderful people.\r\n* I live in a community of 4 buildings, one big shared garden, 15 adults and 6 children (more planned or on the way!), 3 hot tubs and lots of cats. We each have our own units, so we don\u2019t have to agree on how clean our kitchens, bathrooms, etc are. It\u2019s co-livinging for grownups and it\u2019s great. You might love it too. \ud83d\ude00\r\n* I\u2019m loath to leave SF permanently but I\u2019m also really eager to find an amazing partner and am willing to look in many other places for her. Europe (especially Berlin) and New York tug at my heart. I recognize that I might get lured away from SF, but I\u2019ll also try to lure you here. Maybe we can travel a lot.\r\nChildren\r\n* I used to be pretty strongly opposed to having children. I\u2019d be married at least twice by now if it weren\u2019t for that.\r\n* I still don\u2019t need to have children, but now I can now see a path where I\u2019d be excited to have children: with a partner who is highly aligned on values and goals, and in a community like the one that I live in, with lots of social contact built in, so that parenting isn\u2019t as isolating.\r\n* The two biggest things that changed my mind about children are (1) seeing how different parenting is when done in community, and realizing that the future will be less awesome if a whole group of us opt out of having children.",

I try not to give weight to typologies, but INTJ and Enneagram 1 describe me well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m an intense person who goes all in for the things I care about.\r\nI naturally like to optimize, but lately have been evaluating this mindset.\r\n\r\n\r\nI adore unconventional ideas (e.g. I sleep in a sleeping bag on the floor with no pillow) and highly value authenticity and open-mindedness. Deep relationships are most important to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n.What I\u2019m doing with my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI graduated college in May and am still figuring out my career. Since graduating, I\u2019ve helped Democratic campaigns in the US. I worry that if we don\u2019t address facism in the US (if it\u2019s not too late), it will be much harder to address all the existential crises we\u2019re facing. I\u2019ll likely continue on the politics/campaign path for at least the next four years.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love climbing and anything in nature (I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail three years ago), reading nonfiction, journaling, philosophy (esp.

I\u2019m monogamous and am not sure yet if I want kids. I\u2019m currently based in Northern Virginia (but move depending on work) and am willing to relocate.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffGrant\r\n30yr old male from Basingstoke, England looking for a date\r\nIntro\r\nThere\u2019s only so many times you can keep swiping past women looking for \u201cgolden retriever energy\u201d and a \u201ctime and place\u201d before you lose your sanity and realise a change in approach is needed, so let\u2019s give this dating docs thing a try. I\u2019ll give you an overview then you can decide if you want to go further.  \r\nStory so far\r\nIn terms of finding love my track record is\u2026interesting. At time of writing I\u2019m in my third year of dating and still very much learning how all this works but proud at how far I\u2019ve come.Whilst not smooth sailing I\u2019ve learnt a lot about myself and what I\u2019m after (which I\u2019ll try to summarise a bit further down)\r\nIf you\u2019ve done the math so far you\u2019ve probably come to the conclusion I haven\u2019t been in a relationship - and you\u2019re right.It\u2019s mainly been wheelspining in first dates with the occasional step into dates 2-4. Whilst not the most glamorous statement on here it does mean I come with no baggage (kids,crazy exes,etc.) so every cloud right?\r\nWhat I\u2019m after\r\nMost of these docs usually end with this section but I\u2019m going to pop it near the top so I don\u2019t waste your time if none of these float your boat.I don\u2019t have a \u201ctype\u201d but do have some boundaries/preferences:\r\n* Kids - This is very much a don\u2019t have and will not be pursuing.If you have any desire for parenthood now\u2019s the time to close this doc and move on.Happy to go into why I\u2019ve chosen this path if asked.\r\n* Distancing Strategies - By this I refer to ghosting/similar tactics.This is a strong no from me and if I get a whiff of this I will be out.\r\n* Attachment style - So I sit on the anxious side of attachment theory and as such would ideally want a secure partner or at the very least an avoidant partner who acknowledges their attachment style and is willing to work towards developing secure tendencies as I am.\r\n* Distance - Preference would be for prospective partners to sit in the range I\u2019ve used for dating apps in the past - within a 30km radius from Basingstoke.I\u2019ll leave this below so you can see if you fit in the bubble.\r\n  \r\n\r\n* Age - Again will keep this in line with my current dating app settings - 25 to 40 year olds.\r\nAs you can see I don\u2019t have any crazy demands (I hope) written down here. Fundamentally I\u2019m after a nice person I fancy - simple as.Title,possessions,etc. are not super important as in my eyes we lose it all in the end anyway.\r\nIt\u2019s the journey/experiences that count.\r\nAbout Me\r\nStill interested? Well then let\u2019s get into what I\u2019m about.\r\nInterests\r\n* Fitness - I currently go to the gym 1-2 times a week with 2-3 running sessions around my work in the week. Running has been something I\u2019ve introduced into the mix tailend of 2024 and has been a fun challenge when it comes to running a 5k. My aim is to get a 5k consistently within 30 minutes in 2025 and potentially look at longer distance running in the future.\r\n* Nature - I like to get out and about around the natural parts of my area. Accompanying me is my dog Daisy who has been a faithful companion and cheered me up in even the most difficult of times.Before you ask, yes you will get to meet her.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Motorsport - One of my biggest passions. What kept me glued to the screen as a kid has turned into my most favorite thing ever and has led to me attending many car events, go-kart races, building my own simulator and working for a F1 team (albeit in their supercar division) - McLaren.\r\n* Pursuit of Knowledge - I\u2019m very much one of those people who will read/YouTube/Google something and - if it\u2019s interesting enough - pursue it.This has led me into learning how to code,how to date/interact with others using cognitive theory and build a computer. If you\u2019ve got any cool things you\u2019ve learnt that you think might interest me it would be good to hear.\r\nBest Qualities\r\n* Open/Honest - I will always tell you how it is (good or bad), there will be no ambiguity around me. If you feel that\u2019s not the case, then you just need to say and I\u2019ll do my best to address any concerns.\r\n* Resilience - Having been through many hardships in my 20s and surviving them, I\u2019ve built up a decent resilience and drive to press on despite challenges.I feel this will serve me well in a relationship as there will be plenty of difficult discussions/issues to overcome.\r\n* Growth Mindset - I\u2019m very much of the opinion that I\u2019m not anywhere near my peak and that there is more to come. If you're after someone who will continue to work hard, even deep into a relationship, I might be a good fit for you.\r\nLife admin\r\nJust so we can avoid the boring bits on the first date and get to the fun conversations, let\u2019s get these life admin bits out the way:\r\n* I have a stable job in Quality Engineering.Not a CEO or anything but the pay is decent and I can typically get a 4% raise every year.\r\n* Understand the fundamentals of money and can budget expenses reliably while leaving funds for savings/retirement/enjoyment.\r\n* Own my own car and can drive.\r\n* Not on the property ladder currently and staying with my mum supporting her through a serious illness.\r\n* Only a social drinker, no smoking or drugs.\r\nMore Photos\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to find out more?\r\nThanks for reading my date doc.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffI am where I want to be. Duluth. On the shore of a beautiful Great Lake, in a definitely Midwestern city with nooks and crannies that are anything but. A big small town where more people know your business than ought to. And more people care than the wider world could imagine. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a 55 yo journalist, writer, poet, designer, philosopher, gad-about, live music/art fan, father of a beaming 7 y.o. girl. \r\n\r\n\r\nSearching for a seriously nonserious woman. A laugher. A crier. A human. A seeker. A reader. A wordsmith. A lover. A passionate jokester. Many things. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrankly, I haven't been much in the dating world since divorce five years ago. No time, I say. An excuse. I can be selfish with my space, I think.

Those teetering into this category seemingly fall into the pit more easily these days. Me, I follow the golden rule instilled by my mother.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut yeah, public behavior at festivals, driving, and just casually looking around. People are dying inside, and taking it out on others.\r\nDon't die inside. Follow your heart and be gentle, even with those who deserve no gentility back.\r\n\r\n\r\nBe raw, honest, relatable. Take nothing for granted, don't back down, but don't just make something a pissing match. That's like following the natural course of water. The easy way out.\r\nPound empathy on your stand. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd be proud, sure of who you are, sure of how someone has you wrong. Correct their course with humanity, kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's lazy to fight. It's lazy to pick a fight. \r\n\r\n\r\nKnow where your heart is, where you want to be. Go there.\r\n__------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind bellows its argument with the ceiling, the sea and unsprouted spring.\r\nIt wends through the alleyways and swirls the surviving leaves.\r\nIt relishes

football.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething funny was written -- a witticism about the spongy ball being a dog\u2019s delight.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I was fixed on that foam football,\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlocking a surprising cache of memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think my childhood ever saw a real Nerf football.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a cheaper, if that\u2019s possible, knockoff.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a pink plastic football\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember.\r\n\r\n\r\nA knockoff of a knockoff, a buying pattern that runs through my early family experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nFake Rubik\u2019s cubes and triangles,\r\n\r\n\r\nLoose and adorned with failing stickers,\r\n\r\n\r\neventually plocked apart by my too-curious brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWe didn\u2019t get Pong until Dad \r\n\r\n\r\nhappened by a yard sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was real Atari -- but so many years too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pong battles burned lines\r\n\r\n\r\nin the screen of our portable black and white TV,\r\n\r\n\r\nanother knockoff,\r\n\r\n\r\nuntil you couldn\u2019t watch any shows \u2013 via a knockoff antenna -- without more imagination than you wanted to exert.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy brother eventually took the TV apart as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nKnockoffs. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the age of brand names\r\n\r\n\r\nand we were having none of it \r\n\r\n\r\nin our recession-pocked existence on the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThe air was real.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe barn.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the animals,\r\n\r\n\r\nall named,\r\n\r\n\r\nour own branding scheme,\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe weren\u2019t focus-group savvy about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Captain Obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\nA rust-colored horse called Cinnamon, \r\n\r\n\r\nher gray sister, Pepper,\r\n\r\n\r\nthe jet-black brother Midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWe named a cow Hamburger, \r\n\r\n\r\nbringing to mind my brother brightly chirping \r\n\r\n\r\nover the Salisbury steak I hated:\r\n\r\n\r\nWho are we eating tonight?\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this streaming\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom a photo on my phone.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nMore than tackle football\r\nduring fifth-grade recess\r\nwith real Nerf football\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nI grimace, but not\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom this trip\r\n\r\n\r\nto a memory\u2019s lane\r\n\r\n\r\nof pre-teen products and uses.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wince with a wont\r\n\r\n\r\nfor a time when I engaged\r\n\r\n\r\nmore wholly in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nActually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot virtually\r\n\r\n\r\nor electro-socially.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat pink football was lost\r\n\r\n\r\nin the open cesspool \r\n\r\n\r\nin the front yard,\r\n\r\n\r\na sewage maw in the earth,\r\n\r\n\r\ncovered by boards,\r\n\r\n\r\nsome broken, with gaps forming.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there went the ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThat pit was filled in\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the new septic came on.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt became second base of our\r\n\r\n\r\nkickball field, marked by a lid \r\n\r\n\r\nfrom a can of knockoff paint.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nHome was the front steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst was a pine tree,\r\n\r\n\r\nthird a boxelder.\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of which remain today. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you hit a certain age, probably 13, \r\n\r\n\r\nyou are constantly told\r\n\r\n\r\nto not look back.\r\n\r\n\r\nForge ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t rue.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs if simple acknowledgement\r\n\r\n\r\nof a life lived\r\n\r\n\r\nwas some sign of malignant sorrow, \r\n\r\n\r\nor akin to sucking a finger for too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nShould my memories\r\n\r\n\r\nbe buried under the sluice of time like that pink football?\r\nIt\u2019s all been a setup, of course,\r\n\r\n\r\nto the knockoff lives lived today.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnengaged and not in any moment,\r\n\r\n\r\nlet alone \u201cthe\u201d moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to stop feeling bad about my reminiscence.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve abstained long enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nI relish this spongy reminder\r\n\r\n\r\nof youthful engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical proofs fading,\r\n\r\n\r\nall I

    ProfileText: "\ufeffSam\u2019s Date Me (or Be My Platonic Lifemate) Doc\r\nCreated Jan. 2025\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nLife is more vibrant when shared: Emotional reactions are heightened when another person is in the room. Experiences are richer when you see them through someone else\u2019s eyes as well as your own. Ideas are enhanced when they volley between two brains. And we need companionship to feel safe and soothed. So I\u2019m looking for someone(s), romantic or platonic, with whom I can share this brief and miraculous existence. \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m easily influenced by the mood and energy of those around me, so I\u2019m looking for someone who brings out the person I want to be. If you are compassionate, curious, encouraging, extraverted (or at least prone to Doing Stuff), and enthusiastic, read on. \r\n\r\n\r\nVision\r\nIn my ideal life, periods of fairly regimented, healthy routine are punctuated by wild adventures. \r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the week, and some weekend days, I anticipate following my morning routine (including meditation), going to work, going to the gym (I lift weights daily, even though I\u2019m bad at it), and having a couple of remaining hours to engage in activities that are both self-improving and genuinely fun, as energy permits (at home, like reading, studying languages, or chatting, or out, like taking a dance class, seeing a play, or going for a hike). I\u2019d love to share these activities with someone. I\u2019m a fan of Cal Newport\u2019s philosophy and techniques for creating structure that allows for productivity without pushing oneself. I would like my home (whether rented or owned) to be attractive, neat, and quiet; I care about aesthetics, and I\u2019m easily distracted by clutter or unpredictable interruptions. I enjoy cohabiting, but I don\u2019t want to be influenced by unhealthy habits like poor sleep or media addiction, so unless the cohabitant(s) is/are conscientious and wellness-oriented, I\u2019d rather live alone. This routine is valuable to me not out of some kind of moralizing asceticism\u2014and in fact, I don\u2019t view it as ascetic\u2014but because it\u2019s the structure and peace I need to do the kind of work that excites me while staying well and relaxed. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut life is for the alive, my dear (as Mrs. Lovett would say), so weekends and vacations are for experiencing what the world has to offer. I easily feel delight and awe in the wacky things that man and nature have created, and I\u2019m novelty-oriented, so I\u2019m not all that particular about what I do for recreation. I am, however, especially interested in travel, as well as entertaining at home by hosting themed parties and game nights. Although during my daily life I prefer to be relatively frugal, I don\u2019t mind spending money on the experiences I value (and on maintaining my well-being), whether that\u2019s play tickets or Michelin starred tasting menus. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you see yourself as compatible with at least one of these elements of my vision? I\u2019m open to a cohabiting partner, an adventure buddy, or both. I\u2019m game for romantic or platonic \u2026 but it would be really neat to fall in limerence. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interests of transparency, I\u2019ll admit that my life currently doesn\u2019t reflect this vision as well as I would like. Even though I look reasonably successful on paper (e.g., have lots of grants and publications, worked at a \u201cbig three\u201d consulting firm, etc.), I\u2019ve struggled to find my groove since the beginning of the pandemic, which coincided with me finishing my postdoc and starting my \u201creal grown-up job.\u201d Health, relationships, and non-ideal housing have all been an impediment, and I\u2019ve been experimenting to find out what works better. Some major changes are in the works for the next six months, including moving and launching the career that aligns with my strengths and passion. It\u2019s perhaps immature to believe that a romantic relationship can \u201cfix\u201d a person, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite what I\u2019m looking for; I am hoping, though, that an infusion of new and positive energy, and a supporter of my routines, will serve as a nudge in the right direction. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nI would describe myself as resourceful, curious, irreverent, passionate, and idealistic. Superpowers: Generating ideas, perspective-taking, offering reassurance, designing solutions, evaluating the trustworthiness of research evidence (i.e., detecting BS). Weaknesses: Attentional control, trusting my decisions/trusting the process, managing energy, patience, singing. \r\n\r\n\r\nStats\r\nLocation: Seattle, WA for ~two years starting mid-2025 (doing a second postdoc), with some flexibility to work from elsewhere at times; I am open to long-distance, including an arrangement where I fly to you for a month at a time and for long weekends, but be aware that I don\u2019t like communicating via email or text\r\nEducation: PhD\r\nAge: 37\r\nGender: AFAB, nonbinary-ish\r\nSexual orientation: Androphilic; open to cis men, trans men, masc-leaning nonbinary, and maybe even a butch lesbian or two (for romantic partners\u2014open to all genders for friendship!)\r\nRelationship style: Prefer kitchen table poly\r\nKids: None and don\u2019t want any; may be open to serving as a fourth or fifth \u201cparent\u201d to a partner\u2019s kids\r\nReligion: Respectful atheist with Buddhist sympathies \r\nPolitics: Pragmatic, favoring left-leaning goals but not necessarily left-leaning means; \u201cCan\u2019t-we-all-just-get-along\u201d-ism; \u201cThey-should-put-me-in-charge\u201d-ism \ud83d\ude43\r\nSubstances: No alcohol, tobacco, or cannabis (though I don\u2019t object if others use them wisely); rare psychedelics for therapeutic purposes \r\nNeurotype: Probably more allistic than average in the rationalist and EA communities, but more autistic than the general population; neuro-piquant, if you will\r\n\r\n\r\nBeliefs and values\r\n(I don\u2019t expect you to share all of these beliefs; diversity of thought is useful! I\u2019m just offering them as information about me.)\r\n* The world would be saved if everyone practiced perspective-taking and compassion and everyone made decisions using cost-effectiveness analysis with the best available evidence as inputs. (In other words, all you need is love and science.)\r\n* Physicalism is true, or at least, there\u2019s no reason to believe otherwise; everything is made of matter and there is probably no parallel spirit world or soulstuff. Spiritual practices and rituals, however, can be worthwhile. \r\n* Capitalism has pros and cons. Markets are magical mechanisms, and I\u2019m skeptical that there are other ways of allocating resources that would be comparably effective, but I\u2019d really like to see markets (and governments) totally redesigned in a way that incentivizes wellbeing-maximization rather than promoting insecurity-generating competition, concentration of wealth, pointless and addictive consumption, etc. I haven\u2019t formally studied econ or political science, so that\u2019s kinda where my hopes end. I am curious about these topics, though. \r\n* Most forms of entertainment media and social media are bad for our brains and trick us into thinking they\u2019re worthwhile, in an analogous process to that promoted by addictive substances. They\u2019re too stimulating and too instantly-gratifying. This is true of other products as well, like processed foods. \r\n* Science rules, but it\u2019s often performed suboptimally. Fixing this is my career mission\u2014one that I\u2019ve thought about for years and have finally started to pursue. \r\n* Aside from physical pain/discomfort, insecurity (about status, lovability, etc.) is the core source of most suffering. If people felt \u201cgood enough\u201d and psychologically safe, they\u2019d be much less defensive, more able to accept others\u2019 perspectives, care for others, etc. In other words, feeling interpersonally secure is intrinsically as well as instrumentally good. \r\n* Emotion is good. Life should be interesting. I want to cry more and laugh more. \r\n* It\u2019s fun to be critical, but it\u2019s also fun to appreciate mediocre art and suspend disbelief.\r\n* Probably some other stuff, but you\u2019ve already spent long enough reading my stream-of-consciousness manifesto, so let\u2019s move on. \r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies and interests\r\nThe items on this list range from \u201cstuff I think about every day\u201d to \u201cstuff I do once a month\u201d to \u201cstuff I aspire to try.\u201d \r\n* Metascience\r\n* Psychology, economics, philosophy\r\n* Effective Altruism (as a question about how to do the most good, not as a fixed set of \u201capproved\u201d cause areas; my favorite objective function is different from most EAs\u2019)\r\n* Travel\r\n* Creative writing\r\n* Reading\r\n* Language learning (did French in school, learned some ASL a few years ago, now beginning Japanese)\r\n* Designing party games\r\n* Performing arts, but not live music (I get antsy sitting there when there\u2019s no visual stimulation or plot)\r\n* Thrift shopping\r\n* Dancing (I\u2019m told I\u2019m a good dancer at weddings\u2014I just make it up as I go along)\r\n* Baking and other one-off \u201carts \u2018n\u2019 crafts\u201d type activities\r\n* Outdoor walks/hikes, with the caveat that I\u2019m cold-sensitive\r\n* Psychedelics\r\n* Buddhism, meditation; curious about relational meditation practices\r\n* Lotsa other stuff too\u2014teach me about your hobbies! \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout you \r\nI\u2019ve already articulated much of what I want; here\u2019s all of it in one place. Yes, I know these lists aren\u2019t grammatically parallel.

I am indeed looking for a romantic partner. Let\u2019s keep this short and sweet\u2026here are some things I\u2019m looking for, and things I\u2019ve got to offer (back to dowry times I suppose!): \r\n\r\n\r\nLooking-for list (for your ease and my graphic design pleasure, i\u2019ve made this a tick box list): \r\n\r\n\r\n* Curious (do you think? A lot? Great!) \r\n* Comfortable with one self/brave (how do you feel about strangers? Being on your own? Sharing your emotions? Dancing in front of people?) \r\n* Funny (don\u2019t worry about specifics, if you make your friends laugh you probably satisfy this)\r\n* Principled (having values and sticking to them (roughly))\r\n* Want children long-term, but not in the next ~3 years (all in favour of procreation say I)\r\n\r\n\r\nExtra points if you \r\n* Speak another language \r\n* Enjoy/play team sports \r\n* Have a creative practice/enjoy the arts and have opinions about what you like  \r\n* Wear a helmet when cycling \r\n* Try not to spend too much time on tech/enjoy spending a lot of time outside  \r\n* Thoughtful consumer \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLatest deals offer list, i.e. what I bring to the table: \r\n* Funny (improv comedy level funny)\r\n* Curious/Big thinker (academically in philosophy and linguistics, but enjoyed more widely too) \r\n* Playful \r\n* Creative (art, music, poetry, dance, theatre, you name it!) \r\n* Big de-digitaliser (gamifying low screen time >) \r\n* Community oriented \r\n* Somewhat spiritual, in that I enjoy spiritual adjacent activities like meditation, 5 rhythms, circling/authentic relating, etc \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I\u2019ve kept this brief, mainly because I\u2019m excited at the prospect of you discovering things about me in real life rather than via a word doc. \r\n\r\n\r\nBoring logistical stuff: \r\n22 years old, final year of undergrad degree at Uni of Ox, intention to stay in Oxford long term (probably) but interested in some periods of being elsewhere/maybe abroad, especially staying somewhere I can practice my french/other languages (german, spanish, open to more!), interested in polyamoury but more recently leaning towards a primary partner in a monogamish partnership. Happy to be swayed by my partner if they have strong desires, but would like to have a conversation customising what our style might look like. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some photos of me for your viewing pleasure ;0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nBig five scores: \r\n* Openness 98 \r\n* Conscientiousness 71 \r\n* Extraversion 85 (I would estimate this is slightly lower, because I absolutely love time on my own, but also love thoroughly love social contexts with the right people) \r\n* Agreeableness 60 \r\n* Neuroticism 42\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested, email me at burnerfahrenheit@gmail.com",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDave Kasten\u2019s Date-me Doc\r\nHi, I\u2019m Dave Kasten!  I\u2019m mainly writing this date-me doc in search of a primary/anchor partner to build a life and have kids with, but if you\u2019re awesome and think we might be a good fit in a secondary/casual partnership, I\u2019d love to talk to you, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basics[1]:\r\n* Man\r\n* 38\r\n* Jewish (And I need my partner to respect that I am, but I don\u2019t need them to be).  \r\n   * I go to Shabbat services a couple times a month, and I host a Shabbat or other Jewish-holiday-related dinner at my home once a month-ish.  I don\u2019t keep kosher and I use electricity on Shabbat. (I\u2019d be willing to explore shomer shabbos / shomer kashrut if you\u2019re Jewish and it\u2019s meaningful for you that your partner be as well.)\r\n* Ambiamorous.  Ideally looking for polyamorous relationships these days, but have been in big, important monogamous relationships too in my life.  Open to either.\r\n* Never married, childless.\r\n* Wants to be married, wants kids (Preferably biologically related to me, but mainly it\u2019s about having a relationship with a kid/kids where they fundamentally see me as a dad).\r\n* Recovering McKinsey consultant, works in AI policy.  Very solid financial health. \r\n* Lives in Washington, D.C., but would move for the right set of circumstances.\r\n* Has Substack, will travel.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m like:\r\n* Extroverted, energetic, a great plus-one to a party where you don\u2019t know anyone. An incredible wedding date for introverts; I\u2019m your wingman.  On your typical Friday night cocktails, Saturday wedding, Sunday morning brunch story arc, I\u2019ll have fully-established inside jokes with 5 of your friends by the time we\u2019re packing up the car to head to the airport on Sunday afternoon. \r\n* Friends, colleagues, and past partners generally tell me that they think that I\u2019m one of the most optimistic people they\u2019ve ever met. (This usually surprises me, I seem to be unable to update on it.  Maybe what I see as my cynicism just helps me mourn the bad news earlier and privately and move past it faster?)\r\n* I\u2019m deeply intellectually curious; my friends once told me that the most common way I begin a conversation is, \u201cSo, it turns out\u201d and then me infodumping at them.  I also sometimes do this before bed.  I hope you consider this adorable.\r\n* My best friend considers me the literal most-invested-in-their-friends person he\u2019s ever met.  My wedding toast for him was 9 minutes long and the best thing I\u2019ve ever written.  (Video available upon request.)\r\n* I love kids; I am writing this doc the morning after running around with all my friends\u2019 kids at our friend group\u2019s holiday party for a few hours.[2] I\u2019m also proud of my signature \u201cmaking moose antlers out of my hands\u201d move that for some reason most toddlers think is the funniest thing they\u2019ve ever seen.\r\n* I go to therapy; have sorted out a lot of my own bullshit, but still working on it.\r\n* A good chef, but much more motivated to cook a big meal for a partner or friends, I tend to be pretty basic when cooking for myself.  \r\n* Exceptional bartender and I love sharing cocktail nerdery with others.\r\n* Enthusiastic but bad dancer; working on the latter part.\r\n* Surprisingly good at putting together furniture and household repairs.\r\n* Fan of Survivor (even though someone needs to take away Jeff Probst\u2019s game theory textbook), Star Trek: Lower Decks, Person of Interest, The Good Place. The Truman Show may be one of the greatest movies ever; so is Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Spy Game is the best spy movie. \r\n* Some favorite books: Seeing Like A State by Jim Scott, The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson, The Scholomance series by Naomi Novik, The Laundry Files spy novel series and Merchant Princes fantasy/revolutionary series by Charlie Stross, Bureaucracy by James Q. Wilson.\r\n* I\u2019m not wealthy by tech industry standards, but by any other industry\u2019s standards my retirement accounts are doing well and I expect that will continue to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you have a flag?\u201d \u2013 Eddie Izzard:\r\n* I was in one really big relationship for 13 years that ended about 2 years ago.  In some ways, you might think of some of my baggage as looking more like \u201cdivorced\u201d than \u201cnever married.\u201d\r\n* I\u2019m mostly estranged from my biological family due to their past bad behavior; my best friend\u2019s family is sort of a second family to me.  I am really proud of the found family I have, but am very unlikely to have support from biological family when it comes to babysitting, etc. one day. \r\n* I had one bad anxiety/depressive episode in my life about 5 years ago; a combo of antidepressants, doing the work in therapy, and major life changes have made this much less of a part of my life.  I\u2019m not ashamed of you knowing about the time my brain tried to kill me, but I think you should know there\u2019s some hopefully-low-but-nonzero chance it could happen again.\r\n* Infrequently have Midwestern guy hangups that make me slower to communicate emotions on embarrassing things than I\u2019d like (though this is much less of a thing for me than a few years ago).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a primary partner:\r\n* [Dies in embarrassment]\r\n* [Okay, I\u2019m back.]\r\n* Is a woman or relatively femme-coded nonbinary.[3]\r\n* Wants kids (bio or adopted), ideally wants marriage.\r\n* Has traditions that matter to them (Jewish or otherwise).\r\n* Romantic and relationship dynamics:\r\n   * If monogamous, has a strong sex drive and is (ideally) a switch.  \r\n   * If polyamorous, there\u2019s more flexibility here but I\u2019d still want to have some flavor of meaningfully-sexually-intimate relationship.\r\n   * A truly asexual child-rearing partnership would be challenging for me unless casual nonsexual physical contact (like cuddling on the couch or spooning while sleeping in the same bed) was part of our dynamic. I think it\u2019s an essential emotional carrier wave for me.\r\n* Is curious about the world; has something they\u2019re passionate about, whether or not it\u2019s the same things I\u2019m passionate about.\r\n* Listens, asks questions, calls me out on my bullshit, but also fundamentally wants to find a way to be on the same team.\r\n* Loves jokes, makes callbacks in conversation to earlier parts of the conversation, plays with words and ideas. \r\n* Someone with main character energy about them, someone who takes stands and stands up for themselves.\r\n* Someone who actually tries to woo me and desires me, and who I feel the same about and treat the same way.  Someone who wants to build a shared life together that grows out of who we are now individually, but is bigger than that.[4]  \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I hope we\u2019d be like together:\r\n* Build a home that\u2019s warm and joyful, where we give each other freedom and trust, and have the security of knowing we\u2019re on the same team.\r\n* Craft a life where we incorporate and create rituals and traditions that matter to us.  Mine are usually Jewish, yours don\u2019t have to be.\r\n* Carve out time explicitly for date nights and time together, plan ahead for when each of our careers and lives get busy, stay connected even when the demands of our commitments strain at us. \r\n* Fight fairly and kindly with each other when we have conflict (any relationship does). \r\n* Travel, at least once a year, to somewhere new.  Have at least 50% of our vacations involve lounging somewhere warm for a bit by the waterside.\r\n* Share burdens fairly and equally (I grew up in a home where my dad was a stay-at-home parent for about half of my childhood, so being deeply committed to household tasks feels much more normative to me than for most straight men I know)\r\n* Have a kid or two, raise them in a home that feels happy and safe, where they\u2019re protected just enough that they can take risks and skin their knees and be daring, knowing that we\u2019re there to catch them if they truly fall, but letting them stand on their own two feet and make their own choices and feel real freedom and agency. \r\n* Challah and dancing to goofy music in the kitchen, warm dinners, curling up on the couch listening to the rain fall.  The whole thing that makes it worth it to be alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to contact me:\r\nEmail: dave [dot] kasten [at] gmail [dot] com.  Thanks!\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] Yes, I am aware the sum total of these adds up to a bit of a cliche.  At least I don\u2019t live in Berkeley \ud83d\ude00.\r\n[2] The children decided that their glowsticks were magic wands that could make me become dead, alive, or a spooky giant monster, and flickered this state accordingly every 45 seconds or so.  I got good at comedic pratfall death scenes.\r\n[3] I don\u2019t love my way of describing this!  If you have better ways of describing what you think I\u2019m saying here, let me know.  \r\n[4] This might seem like a, \u201cduh\u201d requirement but I\u2019ve had some bad and bruising experiences in DC with women who are basically just auditioning me for the job requisition of \u201cJewish husband\u201d and expect anyone given that job to twist themselves into a pretzel to fit into their hypothetical wife\u2019s existing life as-is.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate Me Doc - Aaron Boddy\r\nAt a glance\u2026\r\nLast updated: 27th December 2024\r\nName\r\n\tAaron Boddy (he/him)\r\n\t  \tAge\r\n\t31\r\n\tLocation\r\n\tLiverpool, UK\r\n(But spend a lot of time in London)\r\n\tInterested in\r\n\tWomen, aged ~27-37\r\n\tWhat I do\r\n\tCo-founder of an animal welfare NGO\r\n\tGet in touch\r\n\tRelationship setup\r\n\tI\u2019m polyamorous, I have a transmasc husband (who I live with) and a cis girlfriend (who lives on a different continent).\r\n\tLooking for\u2026\r\n\t\u2026people to play games with, talk about ways to improve the world, and make each other laugh :)\r\nMore specifically, I\u2019m looking for a partner based in the UK to spend weekends with\u2014someone who I really vibe with, where we can support and inspire each other to grow.\r\n\tWhat does my life look like?\r\n\tI am very much a home-bod(d)y. \r\nI live in Liverpool with my nesting partner (it\u2019s a 4-bed flat so we each have our own bedroom and home office). I love being at home surrounded by people I love and my things.\r\nThough my work does require me to travel quite a lot (I\u2019m very fortunate that I get to go to interesting places and meet interesting people), and as a result I\u2019ve started to enjoy being out of the house more and more.\r\n\tWhat could our life look like?\r\n\tA mix of cozy weekends and shared adventures. Whether we\u2019re hanging out at home, playing games, or watching something fun, or heading out to explore new places, I imagine us having a relationship full of laughter, great conversations, and mutual support. We\u2019d inspire each other to grow, share our passions, and make space for what truly matters to us, all while enjoying the everyday moments that make life special.\r\n\tHere\u2019s a paragraph about me written by my husband: \r\n\tI\u2019ve honestly never met anybody else like him. \r\nPensive, methodical, and startlingly intelligent; he has a very unique approach to life which I really admire. \r\nHe\u2019s very quiet, gentle, and sensitive. He gets quite distressed by conflict, and he\u2019s deeply passionate about the things he cares about. He\u2019s incredibly kind, generous, and thoughtful, and he\u2019s probably the most patient person I know. \r\nOh, he\u2019s also incredibly silly and mischievous (when he gets to know you).\r\n\tHere\u2019s a paragraph about me written by my girlfriend:\r\n\tPros: Aaron is extremely dependable and honest. I feel like I can tell him anything and he won\u2019t judge me for it, but will also not jump to be agreeable with me (an autistic superpower!). Out of all my partners, he is the one I feel that I can share my deepest thoughts with. I know that if he says he will do something, he does. He\u2019s pretty decent at physical directions, tech stuff, and organizational management, which is a huge + for me because I get to benefit off his help in these domains. \r\nCons: He is more talkative with people that he has already met a couple times before and generally prefers for other people to initiate/lead conversations. If you are bringing him to a social event where he doesn\u2019t know others well, then you should try not to leave him to his own devices. Aaron also hasn\u2019t dated many people in his life and therefore may not have the smoothest way to rizz you up. He is also a little bit clumsy, but is currently on a workout plan so that might change in the future. And he is allergic to cats (apparently), but with enough advance planning, he can be around cats for an extended period of time.\r\nOther considerations: I really value the impact-oriented life that he leads so the optimal UK girlfriend he gets should ideally actively support him in this way of life rather than be a distraction from it. I would be disappointed if he was derailed from the goal of reducing suffering as much as possible/practical in this world. \r\n\tAbout Me\r\n* Effective Altruism - I co-founded a charity called Shrimp Welfare Project (SWP) after going through the Charity Entrepreneurship Incubation Program. We focus on reducing the suffering of the billions of farmed shrimps. My work at SWP is probably the thing I\u2019m proudest of in my life to date.\r\n\u201cShrimp welfare\u201d can sound odd at first, but the pitch is surprisingly simple: \r\n* 230 billion shrimps are alive on farms at any moment, more than any other animal.\r\n* The evidence suggests they\u2019re sentient and can suffer.\r\n* They often suffer through routine practices such as having their eyes cut off (to induce spawning) and suffocating to death at the end of their lives.\r\nCo-founding SWP was motivated by my deep desire to reduce suffering as much as possible, and it\u2019s been a rewarding journey balancing pragmatism with ambitious goals. The work connects deeply with my values around compassion, effectiveness, and finding innovative solutions to neglected problems.\r\n* Autistic (self-diagnosed) - In 2023 it was mentioned to me that I might be on the autism spectrum. The more I looked into this the more it seemed to ring true, so I typically identify as being autistic (though I haven\u2019t gone through a formal diagnosis). \r\nOne way in which this manifests is that I (currently) have an eating disorder called ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder). It basically means I have a very limited diet of preferred foods, and the thought of eating other foods triggers a physiological fight-or-flight response.\r\n* Polyamorous - I\u2019m in a polyamorous relationship currently, so you might hear me in one sentence talk about my husband, and in another sentence talking about my girlfriend. I\u2019m married to a non-binary trans-guy (who is also in a relationship with a trans-woman). And I also have a cis-girlfriend.\r\nI consider myself to be straight (which is a little confusing as I\u2019m married to a trans-guy). We dated for ~5 years before he came out as trans, and have found our romantic relationship still works well despite it no longer being sexual - which itself isn\u2019t such a big deal when polyamorous. \r\nI think the definition of Relationship Anarchy appeals most to me, with all relationships just growing into whatever suits them best. That said, I find terms like \"nesting partner\" (for my husband) or \"Comet\" (for my girlfriend in America) helpful for explaining the dynamics.\r\nHobbies and Interests\r\n* Making & Creating: Projects and activities I enjoy to try and mindfully unwind.\r\n   * Animation: I love animated movies (my degree is in computer animation), particularly Pixar. I\u2019m also writing a musical with my metamour about animation, which has been great fun.\r\n   * Musical Instruments: I enjoy picking up piano, ukulele, or drums in phases\u2014mainly for the fun of seeing quick progress. Right now, I\u2019m in a piano phase, though I often cycle back to the others.\r\n   * Construction Sets: Building LEGO (or Nanoblocks) is my go-to for unwinding. I have a desk setup in the living room to work on sets while watching TV with my nesting partner.\r\n* Media: Like most people an avid consumer of media\u2026 \r\n   * Reading: Generally non-fiction, my favourite book is Sapiens. I also love candid autobiographies like Strong Female Character, or I\u2019m Glad my Mom Died. My Goodreads is here, if you\u2019re curious.\r\n   * Music: The Beatles are my favourite band, and I love vintage covers (e.g., Postmodern Jukebox).\r\n   * Comedy: Game-changing shows such as Nanette, Inside, and Cold Lasagne Hate Myself 1999.\r\n   * TV & Film: Shows like The Good Place, Fleabag, and movies like The Cornetto Trilogy. I also enjoy so-bad-it\u2019s-good films and ambitious narratives from Charlie Kaufman or Richard Linklater.\r\n   * Games: I love story-driven single-player games (The Last of Us series) and 100%-ing open-world games while listening to audiobooks. My favourite board game is Gloomhaven.\r\nWhat I\u2019m Looking For\r\n* Relationship Style - I\u2019m looking for a partner based in the UK to share romance and intimacy with. I deeply value my relationship with my nesting partner (we have a strong bond but not a sexual relationship) and my \"Comet\" girlfriend (though we only see each other every few months). So it feels strange to say as someone with two partners, but I sleep alone most nights, which surprisingly enough, is starting to feel quite lonely\u2026 \r\nWhat I feel I\u2019m missing is a local-ish girlfriend (while I\u2019m based in Liverpool, my idea of \"local\" is pretty flexible and would include most UK cities - especially London, where I spend a lot of time anyway). \r\nI\u2019d love a relationship that fits a more traditional rhythm: seeing each other regularly, spending weekends together, or staying with each other for longer stretches when it works for us.\r\n* Good Vibes & Value Alignment - I\u2019d love to connect with someone who feels like they just \"get it.\" A partner who resonates with sides of me like effective altruism or animal welfare. Sharing a passion for doing good and meaningful work would make our connection even stronger.\r\n* Love, Support & Growth - I\u2019m seeking a relationship where we can genuinely care for and support one another. I want us to be partners in helping each other grow into our best selves, with plenty of encouragement and kindness along the way.\r\nMore Photos\r\n  \t  \r\n\r\nWelcome to More Photos\u2026\r\n\t  Me and my girlfriend on the Brooklyn Bridge\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nMe and a friend in front of a shrimp-y column\r\n\t  Getting married!\r\n\t  Hanoi Train Street (after Asia Farm Animal Day)\r\n\t  Me and my now-husband, \r\nback when we first started dating in 2015\r\n\t  \r\nEnjoying a vegan cookie ice cream sandwich\r\n\t  In India during our team\u2019s annual \u201cShrimposium\u201d \r\n\t  \t  Getting my copy of Animal Liberation Now signed by Peter Singer!

    ProfileText: "\ufeffShould you date Kelechi?        \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat is this? \r\nIf you didn\u2019t land here from a Date Me directory, you might be wondering what this is and/or think this is weird (fair). Here\u2019s a NYT Article that explains the idea. I just think of it as a custom dating profile that\u2019s not tied to a specific app.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t think this is that strange, then you\u2019re probably the kind of person I\u2019m excited to talk to.\r\nStatement of Purpose\r\nWhat I value most in a romantic relationship is 1) intimacy \u2014 Do I feel safe with you? Do we communicate well?\u2014 and 2) collaboration \u2014 Do we have fun together? Do we work well together? Do we get energized by similar pursuits? I\u2019m looking, in short, for a mix of a playmate, a confidante, and a collaborator. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, my significant other and I would design our lives around compelling joint adventures. Maybe we spend one week painting a mural, another two weeks figuring out how to raise chickens, then two months fixing up a RV for a cross-country road trip. To me, a life well spent is one filled with creation and worthy pursuits. A life where your experiences teach you a lot about yourself and the world, and you leave some beautiful things behind you. If you know someone who has a similar view, please share this with them. If you are that person and you\u2019d like to meet me, fill out this form or reach out directly at knwankwoala2@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This doc is much longer than it needs to be. Don\u2019t be threatened! Feel free to read as little or as much as you like, grabbing the parts that are most intriguing to you. No need to read everything before hitting me up. Dating is better with a little bit of mystery. \r\nBasics\r\nI'm a sparsely tattooed cis-male, 25 years old, 5\u20199\u201d, Nigerian-American, living just outside New York City. I am currently working on pivoting to software engineering from marketing analytics/research. Extraverted introvert NOT introverted extravert. I'm poly-oriented but currently unpartnered. If poly is a deal breaker for you, let\u2019s talk about it. I'm open to having kids at some point, but I\u2019m not looking to have any in the next years.. In the long term, I imagine myself living somewhere with easy access to nature and outdoor recreation. I\u2019m not particularly tied to any place or region, though I am very fond of New York. I don\u2019t smoke. I drink occasionally. I imagine I lived a past life as an octopus or a raven. \r\nAbout Me\r\nCurious, Adventurous, Eclectic\r\nMy default orientation to most activities is I'm down if you're down. I tend to crave highly intense sensory experiences. Activities like sky-diving, skiing, and motorcycle riding really appeal to me, and I tend to feel most myself moving fast downhill. I'll do anything once, and I\u2019m the kind of friend where if you do something silly, I probably will do something sillier to make you laugh. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a short but non-exhaustive list of the kinds of things that sound fun to me but might be polarizing to others. \r\n      * Creating and maintaining an ant farm\r\n      * Beekeeping\r\n      * Learning falconry\r\n      * Building your own log cabin in the woods\r\n      * Living on a sailboat\r\n      * Doing a triathlon\r\n      * Owning ferrets\r\n      * Getting my pilot\u2019s license\r\n      * Breaking the world record for the largest blanket fort\r\n      * Murder mystery parties\r\n      * Designing my own pants\r\n      * Screen printing shirts\r\n      * Learning to weld\r\n      * Circling\r\n      * Sensory deprivation tank\r\n      * Climbing a mountain\r\nIntellectual & Philosophical\r\nMy primary orientation to life is analytical. I desire to think clearly, and it\u2019s important to me to be with someone who also values what I\u2019d call \u201cintellectual hygiene\u201d. I want to date someone who helps me to be a better thinker and a better truthseeker. Stress test my claims; point out when I'm getting sloppy and judge me for it. Keep me accountable. I know that all sounds fairly serious, but I\u2019m hoping that means we can discuss \u201cbig\u201d topics in a more generative and joyful way. You can, in principle, convince me of anything.\r\nGrowth-Minded\r\nI have a healthy amount of ambition, but most of it is directed at self-improvement rather than status. I care less and less about winning a trophy and more about fostering new capabilities in myself, being able to create and do new things. My version of happiness, in short, is eudaimonia, continually striving to develop your own idiosyncratic excellence.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t expect my partner to be exactly as ambitious, but I think a certain amount of restlessness will be needed. More will be appreciated. If striving disconcerts you, we may not be a good match. \r\nPlayful, Whimsical, Enthusiastic \r\nI love, love games, of pretty much all kinds. I\u2019m not good at them, but I love them. I think there\u2019s something about the clearly defined rules and conditions my mind likes, especially when it comes to social games like Mafia. Chess and I are well-acquainted. I\u2019m a big fan of improv. DnD is a core passion of mine. I\u2019m competitive in games, meaning I won\u2019t go easy on you, but I\u2019m collaborative too. I think I\u2019m really good at being deadly serious about silly things. I\u2019m decidedly at my social best in a one on one conversation or an activity based hang. \r\nQuietly Romantic, Style-Conscious, Sensitive \r\nUnlike a lot of rat/EA-adjacent folks, I\u2019m more word-cell than shape-rotater. My mental homebase has always been the verbal, and with that comes a kind of deep, gut-feeling appreciation for style. I think what it is is that my world-building and sense-creating muscles have grown (overly?) strong over a childhood of heavy reading. My feelings are quite sensitive to ideas, and so I\u2019ve become fascinated by how art manages to provoke those feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can always interest me in an in-depth discussion of a book, a movie, or a poem. I think it\u2019s hot when people identify how they think the stylistic features of an art piece are or are not functioning. Some of my favorite books, The Art of Cruelty by Maggie Nelson, Touching Feeling by Eve Sedgwick, or Feel Free by Zadie Smith are just that, really detailed and thoughtful accounts of the human response to art. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of my own art practice, I write poetry from time to time and would like to eventually publish some essays and short stories. I draw at the level of a talented 13 year old. I\u2019m not musical in any way, but I\u2019m really into listening to it. I\u2019ll wax poetic on MF Doom as easily as Panic! At The Disco. Fashion-wise, I have often been told I have good style, but I guess that\u2019s up for you to decide. \r\nGrounded, Cozy, Soft, Systematic\r\nI know, I know. I\u2019ve talked a lot about striving and adventure, but to be honest, I\u2019m also a big creature of comfort. A lot of my striving takes the form of personal projects, which I try to get  done in cozy environments \u2014 my office, a cute coffee shop, a nice library. I really like the feeling of being in a room where everything has its place. I\u2019m particularly partial to gothic, japandi, and rustic/log cabin interior design. I\u2019m fond of Tudor houses. \r\n\r\n\r\nI love cuddling. One of my favorite things to do is to nap in a comfortable bed with someone else. Physical touch is definitely one of my biggest love languages. \r\nMiscellaneous Info \r\nLikes\r\n* Perfectly ripe avocados\r\n* Journaling in the morning with a cup of coffee by a medium-small body of water\r\n* Adrienne Lenker lyrics\r\n* Runner\u2019s high\r\n* When you surprise yourself using a word you just learned in a conversation\r\n* Malapropisms\r\n* Adventure Time\r\n* Fauvism\r\n* Brennan Lee Mulligan\r\n* Tabletop role playing games\r\n* Imagining the tenth dimension\r\n* The poetry of Terence Hayes\r\n* Bluets by Maggie Nelson\r\n* Etymology\r\n* Seeing a bird I've never seen before\r\n* Poussin\u2019s paintings\r\n* Studying at research libraries like the State Library of New South Wales or The Reading Room at Brody\r\n* Formal/Genre experiments\r\n* This hotblack music video about good and evil\r\n* Short stories\r\n* The monologue at the end of Childish Gambino's Camp\r\n* The Binding of Isaac (the game, not the biblical story)\r\n* The films of Yorgos Lanthimos\r\n* Indie websites\r\n* On being the right size\r\n* Micheal Cera\r\n* Fiona Apple\r\n* Rapping the entirety of an Earl Sweatshirt verse perfectly\r\n* People Watching\r\n* The look of shaved hair on a barbershop floor\r\n* Tilda Swinton\r\n* Self-referential lists \r\nThings you would think I'd like but I somehow don't\r\n* Really big crowds\r\n* Concerts/live-music events\r\n* Zoos\r\n* Star Trek\r\n* Rock climbing (pretty neutral towards it honestly)\r\n* Letterboxd\r\n* Marvel Comics\r\n* Basketball\r\nThings you would think I don\u2019t like but I really do\r\n* Public speaking\r\n* Carly Rae Jepsen\r\n* Celine Dion\r\n* The Sound of Music\r\n* Disney movies\r\n* McDonald\u2019s Sausage EggMcMuffins \r\nSigns We Should Date\r\n* You have a favorite philosopher\r\n* You read Walden and thought wow I wish I could do something like that\r\n* You have good, if unfounded, feelings about 70's era hippies\r\n* You are currently reading a book \r\n* You love to discuss movies after you finish them\r\n* You like board games\r\n* Someone has accused you of having autism\r\nMy \ud83d\udea9\r\n* I'm still really close with my best friend who happens to be my ex.\r\n* I tend to be pretty independent & self-centered. I can occasionally come off as cold. I\u2019m getting better at being more proactively community/other oriented. \r\n* I'm not very conscientious at all \u2014 all of my executive functioning is hard won and I suspect they will disappoint you if you are naturally Type A\r\n* My cat sleeps in the bed with me, which I objectively think is gross but I subjectively don't want it any other way.\r\n* I can occasionally be pretty introverted. Hopefully you don't mind staying at home a couple weekends in a row? We\u2019ll do something big to make up for it. \r\n* I have a big family and they are pretty traditional and boisterous. Even I think they can be abrasive. They mean well, though. \r\n* I sleep a lot\r\n* I\u2019m not a great texter. Please call or email me!!\r\n* I tend towards rugged minimalism. I\u2019m a big saver. I hate spending on frivolous things. \r\n* I\u2019m an atheist and more intolerant than I\u2019d like to be towards sincere believers. \r\n* I read Infinite Jest and liked it.\r\n* Big overthinker, intermittently in need of social reassurance \r\n* My humor tends to be bawdy and gross or absurdist and over-intellectual. I watched too much Adult Swim as a kid. \r\n\r\n\r\nFriend Reviews\r\n\u201cKelechi is the perfect balance of intellectual, witty, comical, great sex and sincere.\u201d \u2014 My best friend/ex \r\n\r\n\r\nTBD\r\nAbout You\r\nTBD\r\nA Day in Our Life\r\nTBD\r\nCall to Action\r\nAfter reading all that, if you think we could be a good match (or you have a friend who might be), fill out my form, email me at knwankwoala2@gmail.com, walk up to me on the street and say \u201cCome with me, Mr. President\u201d, throw pebbles at my window, write me a poem, or send me a document like this of your own! (If you're not sure what to say, tell me about a favorite book or a thought that\u2019s been on your mind.) If you\u2019re uncertain, err on the side of getting in touch.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDaniel Filan\u2019s date-me doc\r\nLast edited 2024-12-09, best viewed on desktop\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nHi! I\u2019m Daniel Filan! Here are some basic things about me:\r\n* Man\r\n* 5\u20198\u201d, ~170 lb\r\n* Born March 1994\r\n* Berkeley, CA\r\nI\u2019m looking for\r\n* A woman\r\n* \u2026 to (eventually) be in a committed relationship with\r\n* \u2026 that ideally leads to having kids.\r\nInterested? Email df@danielfilan.com, or reach out some other way (e.g. via twitter). Want to know more? Read on.\r\nWhat I\u2019m like\r\nI work in the field of AI research\u2014specifically, research that aims to reduce the chance that AI takes over the world. At the moment I\u2019m helping run a research internship program and helping manage the interns. I also make a podcast where I interview people in the field about their research.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment, my main hobby is learning Latin. Other present and past hobbies include contra dancing, learning about the history of Christianity, and watching anime. I also try to do intense cardio exercise at least twice a week, and enjoy taking long walks (I recently walked 17 miles diagonally across San Francisco).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I had to describe my general vibe, I would say that I\u2019m academic-shaped. The thing I am best at is studying, and if I may flatter myself, I think I would make a good 60-year-old whose job was to be generally erudite and warm.\r\nTestimonials\r\nI\u2019m bad at describing myself, so here are some friends\u2019 descriptions of me:\r\n\r\n\r\nAsya Bergal (excerpts below, full testimonial here, bolding original):\r\nDaniel is very (intentionally) funny, at least to me and a lot of people whose sense of humor isn\u2019t too far from mine. IMO the best thing about Daniel is a mixture of being generative, funny, and low-ego that reliably makes me joyful (often laughing) and at   ease when I\u2019m around him. I think he fosters this feeling to a really unusual extent among people I know, and I suspect the optimal long-term partner for Daniel will be someone who really likes that feeling and wants to live in it forever.\r\n* [...] several individuals from different parts of my social network have unpromptedly expressed to me that they find Daniel very good to be around, including one who I think of as extremely judgmental and perceptive.\r\n\r\n\r\nEli Tyre:\r\nDaniel Filan is among the top 10 highest integrity people that I know.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ:\r\nDaniel is interesting to talk to, he knows many things. I usually get a bit anxious around new people but did not feel that way when talking to Daniel - he seems nonjudgmental and is also occasionally funny :p\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Steidley:\r\nDaniel is a fantastically passionate guy. He\u2019s always interested in some new topic and learning everything about it. He\u2019s funny. He\u2019s cheerful. He\u2019s a delight. It\u2019s extremely rare to find him in a bad mood. \r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel stands up for what he believes in, but also admits his mistakes quickly and completely. He\u2019s terrifically smart.\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\r\nAt a high level: intimate, reliable, and comfortable companionship that helps me grow in unexpected ways and can serve as a foundation for the rest of my life. But I think that\u2019s pretty generic. So here are traits someone could have that I think predict I would get on well with them:\r\n* Being analytical\r\n* Being ambitious but also (at least somewhat) pro-social\r\n* Being curious and open-minded\r\n* Favouring bluntness and honesty, while trying to maintain tact\r\nCompatibility\r\nHere are some things about me that will maybe help you predict whether we\u2019re compatible. They are \u201cthings about me that you may or may not want\u201d, not things I\u2019m asking of partners (except for the children + location entries).\r\n* As mentioned above, I think I want kids. I\u2019m not dead set on them, but they seem pretty cool, and in general I\u2019ve observed that my positive affect towards babies and children has grown a lot in the past 5 or so years.\r\n* I live in the SF Bay Area. Moving for a relationship is not totally out of the question, but the bar for doing so is quite high.\r\n* I\u2019m asexual. I enjoy physical contact, but having sex doesn\u2019t feel desirable or attractive to me.\r\n   * I\u2019m open to polyamorous relationship arrangements, but would want to be in a primary/committed role.\r\n* I\u2019m vegan, and disapprove of the consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy. I\u2019m OK with being close with people who aren\u2019t vegan, but I could imagine tension about how to raise any children, or if you think that non-human animal welfare obviously doesn\u2019t matter.\r\n* I don\u2019t really drink alcohol or take other recreational intoxicants (which is to say: I do such things less than once a month, but not never).\r\n* I am very politically libertarian.\r\n* I\u2019m active in the LessWrong and Effective Altruism communities, altho I would say I\u2019m more of a LessWronger than an Effective Altruist.\r\n* I sneeze extremely loudly\u2014loud enough that I have one friend who is genuinely seriously bothered by it (but not so loud that I have more than one such friend (well, as far as I know)).\r\n   * If you don\u2019t have misophonia, I think this will probably not be a deal-breaker.\r\n* I don\u2019t believe in God. I\u2019m interested in the phenomenon of religion, but don\u2019t recommend practicing it.\r\n I am normal and can be trusted with babies.   More photos of me\r\n  ________________\r\n\u2018Fun\u2019 facts about me\r\n* I grew up in Australia. My accent is predominantly general American, but retains a few Australian characteristics (e.g. the way I say \u201cno\u201d).\r\n* The caption on the previous page, while funny, is literally true: I am extremely bad at purposely smiling in photos.\r\n* I can, in my head, approximately calculate the factorials of large numbers, but it takes me an unimpressive amount of time.\r\n   * You can too by memorizing Stirling\u2019s approximation and a few base-ten logarithms.\r\n* I wrote the sentence that Wiktionary uses to illustrate the use of the word \u201cscrutable\u201d.\r\n* I came up with what I believe is the worst unparalleled misalignment yet found\u2014specifically, it was used by the creator of the art form as an example of the epitome of un-funniness and torturedness.\r\n   * It\u2019s Los Angeles // newspaper comics.\r\n* The reason I got around to actually writing this date me doc is that I told someone I would pay them $200 if I didn\u2019t publish one by a certain date. The reason I did that is that I told the same person I would pay them $100 if, by a certain date, I didn\u2019t arrange to make a deal to pay them >$100 if I didn\u2019t publish a date-me doc by a     certain date.",

    ProfileText: "hello! \u2013 hussein.love\nhussein.love\ndate me!\nabout me\nabout my cat\nmoodboard\nHi, I\u2019m Hussein \ud83d\udc4b\nI\u2019m 38, 5\u20198\u201d, bi, and I live in Boston, MA. I\u2019m playful, reflective, and caring; I\u2019m Uncle Hussein and godparent to two kids I love, I have an amazing cat, I do community work, etc; just a normal, stand-up guy with zero skeletons in the closet and absolutely no aspirations to start a personality cult or anything weird like that.\nThere are two things I\u2019m working on right now that are very important to me:\nLiving in a city I love;\nFinding a life partner.\nFor the first: I\u2019ve lived in Boston for 11 years. It\u2019s been a good run, but I\u2019ve recently realized that living here doesn\u2019t make me happy. I grew up in London and there\u2019s something about living in a\nvery\nbig city that makes me feel energized and alive. I\u2019m fortunate enough to be financially secure, so it\u2019s time to make that happen.\nSo: right now my best plan is\nmoving back to London around June 2025\n.\nThis means that finding a life partner is most likely going to happen one of two ways:\nI'm willing to change my plans for the right person\n. I\ndo\nwant to live in a big city, but as long as the energy is right, that could be any number of places. London and NYC are the obvious ones, but there might be others: Chicago? Paris? Tokyo?\nI'm open to moving somewhere else for a few months to try it and see. At the time of writing (Dec '24), NYC is currently a candidate for this.\nI realize that \"embark on a relationship with somebody about to take a big life decision\" is daunting, and I don't blame anyone who doesn't want to take that on.\nOn the other hand, maybe the location does line up... and if you think we might be compatible, why not give it a shot? \ud83d\ude42\nYou live in or around London; or you're London-curious and could imagine potentially making it home.\nI will be visiting to figure out logistics a few times before I move, so there'll be opportunities to meet up then, and we can start getting to know each other meanwhile.\nThe sort of person I am\nOn bad days I think I\u2019m a good person because I\u2019m funny and clever.\nOn good days I think I\u2019m a good person because I\u2019m open-hearted, playful, and kind.\nOn the best days I don\u2019t think about whether I\u2019m a good person at all.\nI recently combined a list of goals and the things I like to do, and they seemed to fall into four values: connection, curiosity, beauty, and vitality.\nIf you are sick I will make soup and bring it to you. It\u2019s an important way I show love.\nSome things I like to do:\nOutdoorsy / light-active stuff: climbing, walking, fair-weather sailing, easy cycling (no lycra);\nGrowing food - I built raised beds in my garden, and love the fresh tomatoes I get from it;\nDIY and making stuff - I\u2019ve made plenty of the things in my house, including furniture and drapery;\nCooking, restaurants, cocktails (though I rarely drink these days);\nAny classical music concert featuring an angsty Russian Romantic composer;\nSelf-expression things: ecstatic dance, finally taking singing lessons.\nI worked in tech for 15+ years and one thing it is easy to do is separate oneself from people unlike you. To work and live and play in communities of people very similar to you, or to have the \u201cdiversity\u201d you experience look like skin color and sexuality and gender id but not wealth or class or education. It is deeply, vitally important to me to\nnot\ndo this, to stay connected to and in touch and aware of the way others live. We may be better off but we are not better. I will not separate myself from humanity.\nMy vice is hookah. If I had one at home I\u2019d instantly die of lung cancer, so I don\u2019t. But I keep finding that the best people I know are down to go to a hookah bar. Doesn\u2019t have to be you, but it\u2019s an easy way to get a \ud83e\udd29 face from me.\nI want one of these. This one is someone else's, but I love her anyway.\nThe sort of future I want\nI believe a life of weeping-with-happiness contentment is possible, and I want it.\n[Update: since writing that, I have wept with happiness.]\nI would like to co-create a life - location, partner, friends, community (which I see as another word for \u201cfamily\u201d) - at a more sustainable pace, where exploration and flourishing is nurtured. I value making sure people are fed: I\u2019ve volunteered making meals for chronically sick people, and also helped run a mutual aid food drive for two years. I want to spend more of my time tackling food insecurity and I\u2019ve got Big Plans to do so.\nI\u2019d like to have kids, and be active in raising them. I think I\u2019d make an amazing trophy husband, which is only a joke if you\u2019re not rich. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve still got more travelling in me: more time in Japan, interior China, a return to Istanbul, and Iran are all on my bucket list. I seem to be converging on India from both directions.\nSpirituality\nI used to be allergic to the word until a friend pointed out \u201cdude, you have a spirit, it\u2019s the thing that makes you you\u201d, and then I was fine.\nThe condensed version of my spiritual biography: I grew up Muslim, but quit in my early twenties because I felt like I couldn\u2019t do it well enough. I came close to falling down the New Atheism rabbithole, but dodged it; in my late twenties I began a quest for capital-M Meaning, which I finally found after lots of therapy and years of Zen practice.\nBuddhism has been important to me for approaching a decade. Buddhist philosophy and psychology is very much a part of who I am, how I think, and how I like to relate to the world. An example: when I filed for US citizenship, I asked for a waiver to the Oath of Allegiance on the grounds of not wanting to support the military, even though being 38 means there\u2019s basically no chance I\u2019ll get drafted.\nIt\u2019s important to me that my partner has their own self-development practice - something that helps them be freer, kinder, and more open. It by no means has to be Buddhist flavoured.\nPotential dealbreakers\nI\u2019m happy to talk about any of these if you\u2019d like to know more.\nI would like to have children (at least one), preferably biological.\nI am open to a\nvery\nsecure relationship unfolding into something monogam\nish\n, if it feels right. The thing I really care about is the \u201cvery secure relationship\u201d part: I think a relationship with good grounding, and the right effort and intention, will become whatever it should.\nI pair better with someone who also has good executive function skills. Being able to trust a partner to get things done makes me feel taken care of, and gives me a profound feeling of relief and safety.\nI am politically far to the left. That said, I have largely disengaged with US politics and treat it solely as a spectacle. These days I am more of an anarchist, by which I mean I believe that community building and mutual aid is worthwhile and morally necessary.\nIf you think Israel\u2019s occupation and treatment of Palestine is in any way conscionable or justifiable, I am not the person for you.\nI\u2019m an only child, and have minimal to no contact with both of my parents. My family is thus entirely chosen. If you\u2019re close to yours, I would love to become part of it.\nI have\na (really, really, really amazing) cat\n. If you viscerally hate cats, or have overwhelming allergies, that\u2019d make it hard.\nI am vegetarian, with very occasional and intentional exceptions. I don\u2019t mind whether you are or not. I do enjoy cooking, and will want to cook for you, so if you\u2019ll feel slighted by me not putting meat on your plate then\u2026 eh, I dunno.\nWhat next?\nThis is the end of the text-heavy part. Thank you for sticking around!\nThere are a few places you can go from here:\nLook at\npictures of my cat\nLook at\nan assortment of pictures and videos from my life\nIf you\u2019re interested, or have something to say, email me:\nhello@thiswebsite\nThanks, and I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for too. \u2764\n[back to top]\nMade with\nGitHub Pages\nand\nReverie",

I generally have a hard time starting off conversations, but I can be friendly and nice once I manage to get over the initial awkwardness. I appreciate quality time spent together, deep conversations and shared laughter, especially if they are over a cup of tea or good food. \r\nI decided to create this file because the idea of Date Me Docs seemed old-schoolish in a cute, nerdy way (in other words, quite appealing, especially in contrast to the shallowness of dating apps). Why not? Maybe the right person for me might be out there reading this doc right now. \r\nHere are some random facts you may want to know about me:\r\n* I am a bit childish: I use colorful fineliners when I write in hand and add many emojis when I type; and I like doing stuff like watching animated movies, singing karaoke and wearing costumes on Carnival \ud83e\udd2a\r\n* I am in the autism spectrum (feel free to ask if you want to know more).\r\n* I have a driving license but it\u2019s been years since I last drove a car.\r\n* I struggle with time management, but I hate it when someone is late.\r\n* I have moved 5 times over the last 6-7 years.\r\n* I can say \u201cI love you\u201d in 18 different languages \ud83d\ude0f\r\n* I LOVE eating ramen and sushi (in case you don\u2019t have any date ideas\u2026 \ud83e\udd2d)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy no picture?\r\nTwo words: privacy concerns. I do not feel very keen on the idea of my picture being available online for anyone to see. However, I will be happy to share my picture with you privately if you reach me out. For now, I can broadly say that I am Caucasian, a brunette, small-sized (short and thin) and that I wear glasses. So I would look something (very approximately) like this avatar:\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy hobbies\r\n* Books. I love reading and immersing myself in a good story. I wouldn\u2019t say that I stick to a particular genre, but I like historical fiction and fantasy most of all. Just let me know if you want any recommendations \ud83d\ude09\r\n* Languages. Apart from English, I can speak Catalan, Spanish and Russian. Now I am learning Turkish too and I also have some basic knowledge of Hindi and Italian. So if you speak any of these languages, we might as well have a language exchange \ud83d\ude09\r\n* Movies. Yes, I know, that\u2019s typical, but who doesn\u2019t love lying on the sofa with a blanket and watching a good (or not so good) movie? Btw, Disney/Pixar movies are among my favorites \ud83d\ude0a\r\n* Going to the theater, museums\u2026 anything cultural.\r\n*  Writing. I am not going to share my texts with anyone for now, but I can say I am working on a historical-romantic novel that might (or might not) be completed some day.\r\n* Traveling. Yes, I know this is controversial and I myself have some mixed feelings about this one because of how everything nowadays seems to revolve around taking selfies and posting how cool you are on Instagram. However, I still like to explore different places and cultures, and it would be great if we could have that passion in common. Some countries on my bucket list: Laos, Cambodia, Morocco, Iceland, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Peru, Bolivia, Uzbekistan \ud83d\ude0f\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\r\nEssentially, I\u2019m looking for someone I can have a mid-to-long-term, caring and nurturing relationship with. I am not interested in long-distance, open or polyamorous relationships (yup, I am a traditional girl), so we might not be well-suited for each other if you don\u2019t live close to Barcelona or are looking for that kind of thing.\r\nWhat I ask for in a partner:\r\n\r\n1. You must be an honest, humble and wholesome person. Yes, that is a strict must, but I think it\u2019s the bare minimum you can ask from a human being.\r\n2. Having an open mind. While I have my own political views and values, and it would be great if we align on those, we will not always agree on everything, and that is perfectly fine as long as we respect each other\u2019s views. Of course, I draw the line at homophobia, racism, fascism and any sort of bigotry or discrimination.\r\n3. Being independent. And by that I mean that both you and I can make plans on our own (we do not have to always do everything together) and that you are able to make your own decisions and have your own thoughts besides what your friends, parents, etc. might tell you. Oh, and being able to do basic tasks like doing laundry, washing dishes or making a simple meal.\r\n4. Having some sort of intellectual curiosity. I am generally a quiet person, but I do like to talk about things I\u2019m interested in and to have deep conversations about life, society, geopolitics, psychology, etc. And if you have a particular hobby or interest or enjoy a specific activity, please do share it with me! I love learning new things \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I value in a relationship\r\nI strongly believe that you need to be (best) friends with the person you\u2019re dating. While attraction is a necessary ingredient in a relationship, especially at the beginning, I would never consider dating someone I don\u2019t trust or someone who is not genuinely interested in hearing how my day went. So\u2026 let\u2019s build that trust and that connection together, shall we?\r\nIf you feel like talking to me, you can drop me a line either on my email, Facebook or Telegram.\r\n________________\r\n[1] Only if you want, of course!",

    ProfileText: "\ufeff* Cis female, 5\u20198\u201d, 37, living in Oakland, California, looking to date men or fairly masculine non-binary people. Most likely ambiamorous. I would equally love a life with kids or without kids. I never could have biokids, so there\u2019s no rush. I prefer surrogacy over adopting from foster care. I\u2019m an electronics engineering student. I\u2019m passionate about earning to give, and hope to work on projects that make the world a better place. \r\n* I want to learn everything about everything from everyone. My biggest goal when I go to a party is to change my mind about something important, and people often say I\u2019m unusually good at it, even for a rationalist/EA. The Effective Altruism movement means many different things to different EAs, but the most important thing it means to me is open-mindedness. I feel possibly my most alive when I\u2019m having a conversation with someone whose beliefs I find deeply harmful, about those beliefs. Their wisdom illuminates so many flaws in my reasoning that I miss when I stay in my bubble. I have a preference for dating people so different from me that most people would consider these attributes dealbreakers, because it allows me to experience moments of adventure like this that I so cherish. I\u2019ve happily made huge sacrifices to live a life on the frontiers of human understanding. I\u2019m looking for someone who also loves learning with all their heart.\r\n* I spend a lot of my free time studying social science through a rationalist/EA lens, and  am looking for someone to geek out with about it. I do things like multiply my vote by maybe an order of magnitude by developing expertise in down-ballot elections, and get so excited about theories of malthusian economics and the evolution of morality that I start writing a novel to explore it. \r\n* I adore tabletop RPGs, where I particularly enjoy coming up with creative solutions to problems, practicing the art of writing, and watching my friend\u2019s personalities shine. \r\n* I often attend authentic relating events; I would be especially thrilled to date someone else who sees each individual human being\u2019s uniqueness as one of the most beautiful mysteries of the universe, and can\u2019t wait to meet each other at the heart of that enigma.\r\n* I\u2019m very agentic; Through persistent hard work, I overcame tremendous disadvantages, vaulting from the American underclass to the upper class. I think there is a good probability my difficult life for someone in our community was worth it because it made me more compassionate, tough, grateful, open-minded, and insightful than I otherwise would have been.\r\n* I\u2019m a lovely intense synthesis of cold culture and deeply caring about people\u2019s wellbeing, both near to me and far away.\r\n* I am quite into BDSM, and am looking for someone who enjoys being sexually dominant.\r\n  \r\n\r\nSome things that sound like a great date to me:\r\n* We attend a meeting together of a community that has very different values from us (Conservative religious? Neo-Nazi? Communist?) and process it afterwards over a cheap meal, ultimately discovering a new truth about humanity.\r\n* We circle together, and discover fundamental parts of each other that we didn\u2019t even know ourselves well enough to name.\r\n* We take a walk where we come alive talking about moments of intense beauty we are witnessing. Sewers saving lives? Plump produce in a grocery store out of an ancestor\u2019s vision of heaven? Oncoming traffic lights shining like stars?\r\n* We find the things we disagree most strongly on and work to overcome our human frailty together until we each realize we are wrong in some way about one of our most deeply held beliefs.\r\n* More civilized dates are also wonderful! I\u2019m a big fan of dinner dates; I love adventure, and what could be more adventurous than a couple weirdos going wherever their curiosity takes them?\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have a deep passion for self-improvement. In addition to traditional rationalist techniques like reading about research on cognitive biases, I often do this through my Christianity. This is the kind of Christian I am: I believe God doesn\u2019t care whether people are Christian or not, love dating non-Christians, and would be happy to raise my child(ren) non-Christian if it was important to my partner. My church is majority queer, I am unusually sex-forward even among rationalists, and otherwise violate all the common stereotypes I have encountered in our community about Christians. I\u2019m Christian because these practices have proven more effective for me for becoming a better rationalist than the methods that work better for others. I want to eliminate every part of me that isn\u2019t maximally truth seeking and replace it with that which is. I utilize the tools that maximize my efficiency in this endeavor. I\u2019m looking for someone just as passionate about becoming a more moral version of themselves. \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat people close to me think:\r\n\u201cSonia is a rare outlier in openness, both to new ideas and experiences. To me she\u2019s tagged as both brave and thoughtful, and self-aware enough to hold onto her boundaries. Lots of charity and empathy along with high decoupling ability\u201d - Damon\r\n\u201cSonia is steadfastly positive, uplifting, and always sees the bright side of things when others might complain. She can have a conversation with seemingly anyone and have a great time.\u201d       - Dmitriy\r\n\"I've found Sonia to be really thoughtful and kind. She seems to think deeply about issues and has a bunch of really original takes. She's also been very consistent about prioritizing global welfare.\" -Ozzie\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf I interest you, please contact me at salbrecht314@gmail.com",

I love `vpternlog` and `vgf2p8affineqb`.\r\n* Location: Vancouver WA/Portland Oregon, but long term flexible, preferably west coast\r\n* 27 years old, 5ft 9in/175cm, 135lb/60kg.\r\n* Affiliations with which I probably have disagreements, but are likely still useful to understand me: Effective Altruism, LessWrong, Rationalist, SSC/ACX, Episcopalian flavored atheist\r\n* Hobbies: reading, writing, cooking, wood working, photography, walking in the forest\r\n* Media: Mushishi, Haibane Renmei, Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou, Madoka, To the Stars, Nichijou, Planecrash, Unsong, HPMoR\r\n* Enjoys snuggles, long walks in the forest, and long intellectual discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI grew up in a house with a few thousand books in a forest. My parents mostly home schooled me, and I read inordinate quantities of books growing up. Having spent the last ~decade of my life focused on career advancement and saving money, I am now in a position to turn my attention to the next few decades/remainder of my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy cooking, and will happily make you good food. While I am reluctant to be strictly vegan due to health concerns, I am happy to optimize in an animal suffering reducing direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am interested in a long term monogom-ish relationship, but am poly compatible if needed. Given an interest in, and non-zero hope of, living to see the sun burn down, I am somewhat reluctant to commit to anything for the rest of my life, but for the right person, I would be happy to commit to stay together for the next 100 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterested in raising children\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren are important. I think my parents did a good job of raising me, but I want to do even better. I strongly want to be a ~full time parent for at least the first ~decade of my children's life. While I am undecided on exact optimal schooling arrangement, I do feel strongly that pure public school is significantly sub-optimal.\r\nRetroactive matchmaking reward (If you yourself are not interested in dating me, but know someone who you think would be a good fit for me):\r\nI place significant value on a long term stable relationship. If I end up in a multi-year close romantic relationship primarily as a result of your intervention, I will pay you no less than $10,000. (Likely more, depending on details.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout you\r\n* Enjoys cuddling and long intellectual conversations\r\n* Wants to make the world a better place\r\n* Is OK listening to occasional info dumps about cool things I am learning\r\n* Likes to infodump about the cool things you are learning\r\n* Is interested in spending a significant part of the next few decades raising children together with me, and trying to make the world better in whatever small ways we can.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think you may be a good match, wish to introduce a potential match, or want to talk for some other reason, please feel free to contact me:\r\n* email: am8ryllis@gmail.com\r\n* Discord: @am8ryllis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nEndorsements (from https://manifold.love/Amaryllis )\r\nWithODEConstraints:\r\nTechnically minded and can smile incredibly brightly when caught off guard by a genuine compliment. She has cute custom cat ears.\r\nIzzy:\r\nThis is my girlfriend who I love very much! She is a very good listener, very non judgmental and open minded, and is overall a very unique and cool person.\r\nAlyssa:\r\nHas lots of cool projects-in-progress in lots of interesting domains, including but not limited to code-related ones, and pretty consistently happy to infodump about them. Cooks good food. Has read and watched lots of interesting books and anime, and fun to chat with about those. Good at rubber-ducking when pursuing projects of my own. In general, is both enjoyable and ~productive to interact with.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information and pictures:\r\nFirst date options:\r\n* Go for a walk in a park together\r\n* Visit my place and I cook you tasty food.\r\n* Visit your place and you cook whatever food you like. (I will eat most anything.)\r\n* Hike in the forest together\r\n* Ride segways together around the local park\r\n* Watch some mutually enjoyable film together.\r\n* Probably a variety of other mutually enjoyable activities!\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe cat ears are optional, but I am quite fond of goats.",

A connection wherein both parties are committed to growth and practicing the art of love on a daily basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have periodically taken career breaks to globe-trot and spend time in awe-inspiring natural landscapes; and would love to continue to do so with my mate. This would require that you be in a similarly financially stable position as me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you give my brain a boner, the rest of my body can follow. Hit me up if you wanna skip the small talk[2] in favor of meaningful conversations on the trail, at the beach, or in bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour character matters to me. Your height genuinely doesn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact Me\r\nIf you\u2019re thinking to yourself, \u201cI bet the most direct way to get into her pants is by filling out a form,\u201d then you\u2019re damn right.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could probably beat you at\r\nPun competitions\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 things I could never do without\r\n1. Snuggles! Preferably with humans and doggos, but a highly affectionate cat will do in a pinch \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\nIf I were a cephalopod, I'd be a cuddle-fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Feeling wonderment and smallness in gorgeous natural settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Vegan meals. A way to my heart and other parts is through my belly. (You don\u2019t necessarily have to be vegan yourself, though.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Laughing so hard it starts to hurt, and inducing said laughter in others.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy underground improv performance at BART Basel\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The pursuit of self-improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The type of intimate connection wherein one feels fully seen, valued, appreciated, held, and empowered to become the best version of themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing people notice about me\r\nI\u2019m a total nerd. And a total dork. And totally love it.\r\n  \r\n\r\nYou can call me Babe-raham Lincoln\r\n\r\n\r\nA day in our life\r\nNote: While this is cribbed from my days right now, I'm very much interested in collaborating with my partner, and would love your input on what you'd like our life together to look like.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaking up to you caressing my body. Time and space seem to disappear as our bodies entwine; there\u2019s only us; our souls dancing together in the ether.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have an ongoing competition between us of who can make the other laugh harder. I thought I'd already defeated you before we even started making breakfast, but by the end of the meal we\u2019re clearly tied.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopping in the car to hit the trailhead. You start playing a lecture from one of The Great Courses, and I periodically pause the recording to discuss what we\u2019re learning together.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting up with our friends for a hike through a beautiful location. You\u2019ve brought gloves for everyone so we can pick up litter we spot along the trail. We take goofy pictures. The group conversations alternate between being silly/funny and profound/vulnerable/informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoining our friends for an epic post-hike meal. Food always tastes better when shared and after your body has worked for it!\r\n\r\n\r\nHeading home for a quick rinse/make out session in the shower before we split up to do our own thing for the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nI eventually head back into our bedroom for my nightly wind-down ritual of putting my phone to bed, silently reading, writing in my journal, meditating, brushing my teeth, and changing into cozy pajamas.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually you wrap up whatever cool thing you were doing and crawl into bed as well, and we snuggle while exchanging gratitudes and setting intentions for the next day. As we drift off to sleep our limbs are once again interdigitated, and the world feels like a calm and serene and lovely place.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] I could also be open to a polyamorous lifestyle, but am not looking to date poly men who already have primary partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Let's instead talk about: relationship goals, commitments, how to better the world, passions, philosophies, lies we\u2019ve told, science, psychology, the quantified self, enlightenment, paradoxes, projects we could work on together, embarrassing stories, epiphanies, bucket list items, lessons learned from previous relationships and other experiences, patriarchy, your personal definition of \"god\", economics, culture, why you're optimistic about the future, hermeneutics, animal intelligence, history, escaping the rat race, traditions, the most impactful book you've ever read, role models, habits, the awe of the cosmos, the awe of humanity\u2019s place within the cosmos, rituals, friendships, altered states, sexuality, what makes you want to jump out of bed in the morning and take on the day, consciousness, social cohesion, anything in my profile, anything in your profile, and whatever else fascinates us.",

A Big Relationship. While I met all my previous loves through organic/IRL activities, I\u2019m open to connecting with someone online. Maybe that\u2019s you! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udc98\nLet\u2019s go.\nTable of contents\nWhy am I so weird?\nWhat am I looking for?\nWhat can I offer?\nHow would we actually get to know each other, Mister Nomad?\nA few references, real and otherwise.\nOkay, interesting\u2026\nMy face in the Dolomites, Sept 2024\nWhy am I so weird?\nBecause weird is the only way to be! But perhaps you mean\ndesperate\n, because I have my own dating page? I don\u2019t see this as an act of desperation, rather an intentional experiment in service of\nONE OF LIFE\u2019S BIGGEST DECISIONS\n.\nAlgorithms dictate enough of our lives already\u2014looking at you, Discover Weekly\u2014and the apps are full of too many\nPerfectly Nice Normal People\ncraving\nPerfectly Nice Normal Lives\n.\nI\u2019m weird in many ways. Ever since I was a child, I\u2019ve had an active imagination and voracious intellect. A few good books and\nunconventional\nmentors\nradically influenced my young adult trajectory. I\u2019ve lived much of my life in community, in nature, on the road, and as a guest. (\nThis\nis a fairly typical Blake-year.) I\u2019m fueled by big projects, new horizons, and deep connections. Normal jobs, homes, and relationships aren\u2019t exactly my thing. So here I am, seeking a partner-in-crime in my own weird way.\nThe links go to my\nwriting\n, evidence of my\nparticular\nbrand\nof\nweirdness\n.\nRunning on the Tahoe Rim Trail, 2023\nWhat am I looking for?\nI\u2019ll offer a few concrete details and then describe the spirit of the thing.\nDetails:\nYou\u2019re a fit, strong, outdoorsy woman. You have pooped in the woods.\nYou have pooped in the woods!\nYou\u2019re in a good financial position: bills don\u2019t stress you out each month, giving you options in life, not just obligations. You have solo traveled abroad.\nYou have solo traveled abroad!\nYou\u2019ve found an interesting way to earn money doing something meaningful. Your work doesn\u2019t dominate your life, and you enjoy\ntime wealth\n. You\u2019re a lover of ideas who reads books, listens to podcasts, and debates with friends. You may or may not want kids, or already have them. You\u2019re not entangled with an ex. Your age probably begins with a \u201c3.\u201d You\u2019re ready for something real\u2014not necessarily forever, but real.\nSpirit:\nRarely have you felt like you \u201cfit in\u201d anywhere in particular. It\u2019s hard to stay settled, because you know how big the world is, and you want to experience it. Friendships matter deeply to you, as do the people you serve. You have a profound relationship with nature which cannot play second fiddle to city life for very long. You\u2019re not looking for someone to complete you, as you are already complete. Your other, non-romantic relationships could genuinely sustain you. But you see romantic partnership as another great adventure, one you don\u2019t want to miss. You have a long-standing orientation toward freedom, both for yourself and your partner. Freedom inclines you toward commitment.\nWith my brother in Buenos Aires, March 2024\nWhat can I offer?\nGreat conversation, moral support, foot/back rubs, mountain adventure partnership, co-counseling in the style of \u201cwhy\nnot\nattempt this seemingly crazy but delicious idea?\u201d, creative collaboration, spontaneous dances, quiet evenings reading together on a couch, winters spent together in sunny places, petting cats on the street, plenty of time+space to do your own thing\u2014and tacos, so many tacoooos! \ud83c\udf2e\ud83c\udf2e\ud83c\udf2e\nMaybe\na co-parent who seriously buys into the \u201ctravel the world with kids\u201d notion.\nMaybe\na child-free partner who nonetheless enjoys hanging with friends\u2019 kids and taking them on amazing adventures. 100%: a trustworthy, high-stoke, sun-loving, cheery-optimistic California boy.\nMama always said, \u201cdate a boy who can dance.\u201d Evidence:\n1\n/\n2\nHow would we actually get to know each other, Mister Nomad?\nValid question! Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we lived in the same place and could casually meet like\nNORMAL PEOPLE?\nAlas, unlikely to happen. So here\u2019s my next best idea.\nFirst,\na\nvideochat\n. No expectations! Let\u2019s just assume we\u2019ll have a nice conversation and become friends, acquaintances, or two charming, oddly good-looking ships passing in the night. If we vibe, more videochats.\nIf vibes are\nstrong\n, we craft\na mutually exciting plan to meet\n. This could be me visiting you, you visiting me, or both of us meeting someplace new, for a few days to a few weeks. Did you ever read\nThe craziest OkCupid date ever\n? It\u2019s an inspiring (and admittedly extreme) blueprint for what\u2019s possible. Even if it \u201cdoesn\u2019t work out,\u201d we both have a fun story to tell our friends:\nWe ended our journey after eight countries, 3,500 miles and 21 days in the same clothes. Our romantic relationship intact, Jeff and I boarded the Heathrow return flight as closer friends than ever (despite the questionable state of our undergarments). Materially speaking I was as empty-handed as the day we started, but I actually carried a great deal back home across the Atlantic. Traveling with no luggage and no plans was much more than a minimalist lesson in living well with less. It was an intense, in-your-face invitation to the unknown. There\u2019s a truly magnificent side to the unknown, but we aren\u2019t taught how to welcome it, let alone explore the breadth of its possibilities.\nAfter this point,\nwe are two adults who figure things out\n.\nI\u2019m genuinely open to creating a life in many different parts of the world\u2014as long as it\u2019s not the same place all the time!\nCycling with friends on the Carretera Austral, 2024\nA few references, real and otherwise.\nSome years ago, I asked close friends to write\ndating endorsements\n, which are like job references but far more entertaining.\u00a0 \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd\nHere\u2019s what they said\n\ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffd\nAnd here are some\nfictional references from my exes\n, which I wrote:\nE1\n: \u201cBlake\u2019s a lot of fun, and very enthusiastic. He can also fall in love awfully quickly. Maybe dial down the romanticism from a 10 to a 7?\u201d\nE2\n: \u201cIt was pretty easy to live with Blake. I was also flexibly self-employed, and it was nice to spend time together when others were working 9-to-5. He helped me with my art shows. It kinda sucked when he went away for multiple months on those teen trips. He\u2019s got some sort of addiction to the mountains, like it\u2019s some core part of his identity. He judged me for not being \u2018adventurous\u2019 enough. Get over yourself, man.\u201d\nE3\n: \u201cBlake and I fell for each other despite living on different continents. We loved going to dances together. In the beginning it was invigorating, but eventually I realized that he\u2019s probably never, ever, going to settle down. I wanted to have a rather normal life in a single place, while he wanted to live in some magical land of infinite possibility, sunshine, and chocolate. I do appreciate the effort he put into establishing a friendship after we broke up. Dating Blake could be chaotic, but it was a meaningful, memorable kind of chaos.\u201d\nE4\n: \u201cHe\u2019s a great cycle touring partner. He\u2019ll cook for you and clean your kitchen afterwards. And it\u2019s fun to work on creative projects together. Beyond that, I\u2019m not sure what to say. He\u2019s got a bit too much time on his hands.\u201d\nAnother great lurking opportunity:\nTikTok\n!\nDesolation Wilderness, California, 2021\nOkay, interesting\u2026\nWhere do we go from here?\nYou\u2019re welcome to reach out directly (\ud83d\udce7yourstruly@blakeboles.com), but you\u2019re also invited to\nemail my friend Julie\n(\ud83d\udce7 mcp.julie@gmail.com).\nJulie and I have known each other for 20+ years.

My current favorite is: \"What has been on your mind recently?\"\r\nSome random facts about me\r\n* I own a driver\u2019s license, but haven\u2019t driven a car since I got it in 2018.\r\n* I love going hiking, and exploring new cities.\r\n* I play board games quite regularly, e.g. Frosthaven, but also more social/leight-weight games like Avalon or Codenames.\r\n* During my Masters degree, I did two exchange semesters in Eastern Finland.

Everything else is negotiable.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil June I was CFO of a little charitable clinic. Nowadays I\u2019m working on indie publishing my fourth sci-fi novel. My readership numbers might charitably be called modest, but I\u2019m told one should not despise small beginnings. I\u2019ll work full-time on writing for the next 6 months, then re-evaluate.\r\n\r\n\r\nI live in Atlanta, about 1 mile OTP.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m complementarian.

She could totally drive a tent peg through an evil general\u2019s skull, if the situation called for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies include Ultimate Frisbee (unathletically), CrossFit (unfitly), any and all game nights that I\u2019m invited to, etc.  I have other dormant hobbies that shall rise again: improv comedy, ukulele, bridge (the card game).\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven\u2019t dated much.

    ProfileText: "\ufeff\"I'm Kaden Sieracki, and I hail from The Woodlands, Texas. My two brothers, one older and one younger, keep things lively around the house. As for me, I'm a bit of a gentle giant at 6'8\" and 300 pounds. I'm proud to represent Baylor on the offensive line. When I'm not on the gridiron, you can find me diving into the worlds of Transformers, Marvel, and Star Wars. And though my golf game might need a little work, I love hitting the links whenever I can. As for music, I've got a pretty eclectic taste. Lately, I've been jamming to a lot of grunge rock and country, but I also have a soft spot for those classic 2000s pop hits.\"\r\n\"I\u2019m looking for a woman in her early 20s, ideally a bit taller than 5\u20197\u201d. I\u2019ve always had a thing for freckles and brunettes, and I\u2019m drawn to someone with a sharp wit who can keep up with my dry humor and oddball jokes. Music is a big part of my life, so I\u2019d love to find someone who shares my tastes. While I might be a football fanatic, I\u2019m totally cool with someone who doesn\u2019t follow the game, as long as they can appreciate a good touchdown or a clutch field goal.\"\r\n\u201cI really love living in the South and hope to stay here for a long time. I\u2019d also love to start a family around the age of 29 or 30. That way, I\u2019ll still be young and active enough to play with my kids when they\u2019re growing up. My dad had me when he was 40, and it was tough for him to keep up with me and my brothers. So, I\u2019m hoping for a different experience.\u201d \r\n\"I'm looking for someone who can appreciate my weirdness and share in the joy of life's simple pleasures.\"\r\nSelf-Disclosure: 've been trying to be more honest about myself recently, providing details that go beyond the fundamentals. Talking about my passion of sci-fi, such as Transformers, Marvel, and Star Wars, as well as my problems on the golf course, helps people understand who I am. It's more than just listing statistics; it's about revealing the aspects of myself that make me unique, such as my strange music choice and my desire to have a family someday. By being more honest, I hope potential partners may look beyond what I do and gain insight into my life.\"\r\nSelf-Esteem: When I composed this document, I felt compelled to be true and honest with myself. I mostly discussed my talents and weaknesses. and about my unusual characteristics. I would say I am not afraid to disclose that I am a larger guy, that I play offensive line, and that I am content with my height and weight. I also discuss my strange and eccentric interests, as well as how I am seeking for someone who shares my dumb sense of humor. I think it's incredibly vital to have confidence in yourself. \r\nSelf-Monitoring: I tried to be myself while still being aware of how I came across. I wanted to appear open and pleasant, so I kept my language light and conversational. I chatted about things I like, hoping to meet someone who shared my interests. I also listed topics that are significant to me, such as where I'm from and my goals for the future. I wanted to attract someone who was a good fit for me without feeling compelled to change who I am.\"",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate Elliot, why not?\r\nI mean what\u2019s the worst that could happen?!\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho the hell am I and what am I looking for?\r\nI am an actor. (Photos on the next pages are from that.) Previously I have been a UX designer, a behavioural scientist, and, a long while ago, a software engineer. I am 40, I live in London, UK, I don\u2019t want kids, and I\u2019m looking for a long term relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\nHold on, this is important!\r\n* I am shorter than you. (Yes, even you.) I\u2019m 150cm.\r\n* The reason for that is I have a curved spine, so my upper body also looks a little different.\r\n* That\u2019s not my cow! ->\r\n\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t need to know you\u2019re OK with that at this stage. But you gotta be honest with yourself and think there\u2019s a reasonable chance you could be. (Especially the cow thing.) Read on and contact me if you think there\u2019s a chance.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tMore about me\r\nI tend to look on the bright side, and make people laugh. Taking care of the people I love makes me happy. I\u2019d really like to find someone of a similar disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from acting, I also sing in a couple of choirs (music is a big passion of mine), and volunteer as a cook in a community kitchen. I like cooking a lot, and may try to win your favour with baked goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a cat. His name is Zagreus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat about you?\r\nI am looking for someone who shares my romantic disposition. A person who wants to love, and be loved. I also value thoughtfulness, self awareness, and curiosity. I'm looking for someone with a similar desire to be happy, to be happy together.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact me\r\nAgain, note my appearance! It\u2019s really worth being honest about that now; with, and for, both of us. You don\u2019t need to know for sure, you just need to think it\u2019s worthwhile meeting up to find out.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, if you think you might value kindness and humour (which I have) over height (which I sold to a dwarfen comic in exchange for her humour), then get in touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can email \r\nstubbornminion@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nEither send me your own dating doc or some similar info and photos in the email. I hope you\u2019re the one!",

With a background in both computational neuroscience and software engineering, Carson has planned and executed on high-impact projects at Verily Life Sciences, Google, and the University of California, Berkeley. His work bridges cutting-edge machine vision and deep learning techniques with practical applications in health, such as the development of generative models for digital pathology. Carson's work has spanned basic research in the cognitive neuroscience of human vision, the neuroscience of Buddhist meditative states, and many practical applications of machine learning to diagnostic healthcare problems. His research is driven by a desire to improve human health, happiness, and flourishing, whether mental or physical. He believes in driving forward practical technologies while sharing and publishing relevant scientific findings with the world.\nCarson has a long-running interest in Mysticism, and believes that there \n    is not such a difference between the tools we think of as \"therapeutic\",\n    and millenia-old mystical traditions such as Buddhism and Daoism. A culture,\n    such as ours, which is overly materialistic and has lost touch with the subjective,\n    the natural, and the ritualistic, is at risk of collapsing under its own weight.\n    Carson hopes that his teaching, writing, and research will help bridge this divide,\n    and make esoteric mysticism more legible to the rationally-minded scientist.\nWe rarely hear the inner music, but we are all dancing to it nonetheless.\n- Rumi\nPlease do reach out if you are interested in research collaboration, coaching, or consultation!\nResearch and Teaching\nI have two Neuroscience degrees (Caltech BA 2013, UC Berkeley Masters 2019). I have also worked as a\n        researcher and Data Scientist at Google Machine Intelligence, YouTube, and Verily Life Sciences. My research interests span medical imaging, neuroscience, machine intelligence, and Dharma science.\nGoogle Scholar profile\nLinkedIn profile\nResearch Tools\nAutofluorescence Microscopy\nWhile at Verily, I worked on the\nVirtual Stainer\nproject. We used generative learning to predict histological stains from autofluorescence scans of unstained tissue. See\n(McNeil et al., 2024)\n, in Modern Pathology, and other publications.\nMedical Image Embedding\nI worked on a project to use Masked-Siamese Networks to embed colonscopy videos in a semi-supervised way. See\n(Shor, McNeil et al., 2024)\nFunctional Neuroanatomy\nWhile at Berkeley, I was in the\nGallant Lab\nwithin the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research org, working on fMRI research projects to model the human visual system.\nHuman Emotion\nWhile at Google Machine Intelligence, I kicked off a collaboration between Google and Berkeley to study emotion in human faces using DNNs. 5 years later, this collaboration produced\n(Cowen et al. 2021)\nin Nature. I have an ongoing interest in emotion and mental health.\nDrugs and the Brain\nWhile at Berkeley, I taught the course\nDrugs and the Brain\nunder\nProf. David Presti\n. At Caltech, I taught a class of the same name under\nProf. Henry Lester\n. Psychedelics, as a therepeutic, spiritual, and investigative tool remain of interest to me.\nCreative Content\nScienctific work is creative work. But I have also produced a lot of more casual content.\nSubstack Essays\nMedium Essays (will move to Substack)\nYouTube Channel\nYouTube Lectures\nI have several long-form talks on psycho-spiritual frameworks on my\nYouTube Channel\n.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffEDIT: as of late 2024, I\u2019ve found my life partner. We\u2019re in a non-monogamous relationship, so you can still fill in the form below or reach out directly if you might be interested in a flirtation or fling. I\u2019ve left the rest of this doc unedited from the original.\r\n\r\n\r\nI very much want a life partner who orients towards the world in a similar way as I do. I\u2019m writing this document in the hope of finding her; please share it with women you think might be a good match. I\u2019m male, 30, living in San Francisco, working in AI. Whether or not I have kids will depend on my partner (see section on that below). I\u2019m open to going on dates with people who live elsewhere, but have trouble seeing myself living outside a major global city in the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are five of my defining traits; I\u2019d love to find a partner who shares them with me. If they resonate with you, fill in this form or reach out directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowth\r\n* I think of the world as full of opportunities waiting to be seized - which even if we can\u2019t get to yet, we\u2019ll be able to tomorrow. I want to be with someone who sees themselves as a work in progress, like I am; and whose default attitude is \"why not?\"\r\n\r\nFor me, growth mindset is closely entangled with the idea of making the future of technology go well, which is the focus of most of my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectualism\r\n* It's most natural for me to relate to the world in an analytical, systematizing way. I'd love to have a partner who, like me, is strongly driven to understand what\u2019s going on around them, to grasp the intellectual edifice humanity has been building, and to fill in the gaps themselves - not just in academic domains, but anywhere their curiosity leads them. For a picture of what this looks like in me, try reading my blog or my twitter.\r\n\r\n\r\nI often get along particularly well with people who read a lot as children, like I did. \r\n\r\n\r\nTeamwork\r\n* I want a relationship which is deeply cooperative: two people building something in collaboration, where strong communication is the default and we trust that we can handle problems together. Some examples of how I\u2019ve worked towards this in previous relationships:\r\n   1. Scheduling an hour each week to raise issues and possible improvements.\r\n   2. Taking a course on non-violent communication together.\r\n   3. Doing circling together.\r\n\r\n\r\nRereading that list, it all sounds\u2026 kinda serious? But the spirit I\u2019m pointing towards is much less so: if we can laugh at all sorts of things (including ourselves) together, we\u2019re most of the way towards being a good team. And for me, being a good team is the essence of romance - everything else is built on top of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowardsness\r\n* By \u201ctowardsness\u201d I mean being motivated by actively wanting to move towards desirable outcomes, rather than just away from undesirable outcomes. The latter typically comes from fear-based motivation (as I write about at length here). I think fear-based motivation is far more extensive than most people typically recognize, and that excitement-based motivation which actually focuses on moving towards goals is a kind of superpower.\r\n\r\nI previously formulated this point as a desire for a partner with prosocial motivations. But I now tend to think that overcoming fear (in particular deeply-rooted fear) is the main bottleneck to that, and that almost everyone would have pretty prosocial motivations if they were more emotionally integrated. And so I\u2019m not really looking for a partner who cares deeply about any specific thing; I\u2019m looking for a partner with the capacity to care deeply at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayfulness\r\n   * I balance the more serious traits above with an irreverent attitude towards life. I like spontaneous adventures, I like starting dancefloors, and I like thinking of rules as made to be broken. People are often surprised by how playful I am in person - it doesn\u2019t come through much in writing, where my intellectual side takes charge. (In this doc, my whimsical side keeps trying to slip things in, but my romantic side keeps overwriting them because it thinks finding a life partner is SERIOUS BUSINESS.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person I\u2019m writing this for might not have all the traits I\u2019ve listed (or might not yet know that she does). But because we care about the same things on a deep level, I think she would want to have them eventually - just as the traits that she\u2019s looking for are probably the ones I\u2019m already aiming for. Maybe we can develop them together.\r\n\r\n\r\nA note on children\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main priority is finding the right partner; how many kids I have will largely depend on her preferences. Some possibilities I could be happy with:\r\n   1. A partner who wants to have 3+ kids and to be the main caregiver for them.\r\n   2. A partner who wants to have 1-2 kids and split responsibilities fairly evenly (but also get help from nannies etc, which I'm fortunately in a financial position to be able to pay for).\r\n   3. A partner who doesn't want kids because she (and I) find their work very meaningful and we want to prioritize that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI realize these are pretty different. One way of reconciling them: I want to have life projects with my partner; kids are one possible life project but not the only one; and so it's hard to be concrete before knowing who I want to co-create these life projects with. I'm not apathetic about kids\u2014I think having kids is one of the most life-affirming things you can do. But I don\u2019t want to rule out being swayed towards other life trajectories by the right person.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other things about me\r\n\r\n\r\nMy guess is that, for the people I\u2019m looking for, the traits I\u2019ve talked about so far are likely to be the strongest signal that we should try going on a date. But here are some other facts about me that might help:\r\n   * I\u2019ve spent most of my career at frontier AGI labs, working on a wide range of different topics. Now I do independent research on what I consider to be the most impactful and interesting research directions in the world (a mix of AI governance and theoretical AI alignment). For an accessible introduction to my thinking, try this podcast. I\u2019m excited about my work, and it\u2019s important to me.\r\n   * I embrace life. I seize opportunities to dance, sing, travel, play practically any sport, read, socialize, and try new things. I\u2019m energetic and adventurous.\r\n   * I am fundamentally okay with myself, even as I strive to be better. I don\u2019t easily get flustered, angry, or insecure. Growing up in New Zealand gave me an underlying relaxed optimism about the world (although it's now often expressed via a very Californian type of ambition).\r\n   * I\u2019m unfussy about many conventionally-valued traits like a partner\u2019s level of formal education, career trajectory, finances, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think my weakest traits from a dating perspective are that:\r\n   * I\u2019m not very empathetic on a gut level. This sometimes surprises people, because I'm unusually good at understanding and engaging with my own and others' emotions. But on an instinctive level, when I\u2019m not actively trying to be empathetic, I still tend to default to thinking abstractly rather than putting myself in other people's shoes.\r\n   * I work a lot, driven in part by my belief that technological progress (and particularly progress in AI) is going to accelerate a lot over the coming decades, potentially making this the most important century. This may be disconcerting for some potential partners.\r\n   * I\u2019m short for a guy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m still on good terms with all of the women I dated seriously during the past five years; here are reviews from two of them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Richard is great. 5 out of 5 stars. It didn't work out with us but the quality of friendship we have now speaks for itself. He is one of the smartest people I know. Discussing things with him is great. Sharp and constructive. He has great friends. Absurdly good at any sport. Downside: bit chaotic, no taste for good food \ud83d\ude09\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cRichard is weirdly good at being in a relationship; I can think of three or four concrete ways I'm emotionally healthier after having dated him. One notable omission from this doc is the flip side of him being less empathetic than average on a gut level, which is that it feels easy to express feelings to him and negotiate conflict because he can accept intense emotions without getting caught up in them. He's more whimsical than the doc would suggest, though not less serious. Moreover, he is an excellent kisser and throws very good parties.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some photos of me:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think we could be a good match (or you have a friend who might be), fill in my form, email me at richardcngo@gmail.com, tweet at me, tell a mutual friend to arrange a rendezvous, throw pebbles at my window, write me a song, or send me a document like this of your own! (If you're not sure what to say, tell me about a favorite book or song, or something you're looking forward to over the coming year.) If you\u2019re uncertain, please do err on the side of getting in touch - writing is much lower-bandwidth for discovering compatibility than meeting in person, and the heavy-tailed outcomes here are skewed very positively!",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate Josh\r\nLast updated August 2024. Feel free to share with friends, but please don\u2019t reshare publicly.\r\n  \r\n              \r\n33, male, straight-ish\r\nIf I weren\u2019t a human I would be a golden retriever (confirmed independently by multiple friends!)\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: I live in Boulder, CO. I visit the SF Bay several times per year and NYC/Boston a few, have dear friends on both coasts and enjoy excuses to travel in general. I\u2019m happy to make connections with folks who live far away, but am unlikely to form an attachment relationship across long-term distance. I\u2019m open to relocating for a life partner.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m seeking: Intentional romantic partnership that could grow into family-shaped life partnership; I\u2019d like to reproduce in the next few years but I don\u2019t feel rushed about it. (While I\u2019m open to any connection that sparks mutual delight, I\u2019ll prioritize these over others.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy deal: I\u2019m generally easy-going and rarely have strong preferences; I like doing pretty much anything if it\u2019s with my people. Acts of service are a big love language for me. I have a science and engineering background and have been very successful as a programmer. I\u2019ve had numerous people tell me within a few minutes of meeting me that I seem unusually kind or loving to them. I\u2019m not the most physically graceful person, but that\u2019s been improving of late as I\u2019ve invested more energy into partner dancing. I think I\u2019m a good provider and a good stable \u201crock\u201d. I like puns, dogs, airplanes, and the outdoors, and can operate all of them with reasonable competency.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship structure: I\u2019ve been polyamorous for my whole adult life, because I think being more fully able to engage with connections that might arise is worth some emotional and logistical overhead. At the same time, it\u2019s important to me to be able to offer (and to feel) stability and safety in partnership, even when that conflicts with optionality. My preference is for a relationship that is strongly mutually prioritized but not romantically exclusive. I\u2019m also open to monogamy if it welcomes emotional closeness and non-sexual touch outside the relationship. I currently have one long-term partner whose likely life path looks pretty different from mine; I think she will always be an important core friend for me, while the romantic aspect is more situational depending on how both of our lives evolve.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterested?: There\u2019s a lot more I could say, but it would be more fun to tell you in person! You can reach me using the handle under the photos on Twitter, Facebook, or gmail dot com.",

You all seem like lovely people! Also, your docs put mine to shame\u2026 consider this a work in progress. \r\n\r\n\r\nA heads up: I\u2019m currently quite busy and socially (over)saturated. If I was to invest time into building a relationship with someone (especially online), it would be with the hope of developing a deep poly relationship.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWho am I? \r\nAge: 22\r\nGender: Female\r\nLocation: Oslo, Norway\r\nMonogamy?: God no\r\nWant kids?: Probably not. Not in the near future at least.\r\nLooking for: Women, NB folks, men, anyone in between or outside or whatever\r\nWhat\u2019s important for me?\r\n* EA - I want to use my life to make the world better. Duh.\r\n* Nerding\r\n   * Philosophy, science, maths (eg cognitive science, epistemology, meta-ethics, AI, etc). I consider myself a philosopher at core, but kind of a \u201cnatural philosopher\u201d, Sean Carroll-style\r\n   * Some books that have had an effect on me. No attempt at completeness:\r\n      * Reasons and Persons (I\u2019ve actually read it, I promise! Should\u2019ve skipped the first half though): Very clever about personal identity. I don\u2019t think you have one of those!\r\n      * Chalmers\u2019 The Conscious Mind: If you don\u2019t believe in the hard problem - or worse, think that consciousness is an illusion - I am sitting at the edge of my seat to debate you.\r\n      * Josh Green\u2019s Moral Tribes: I\u2019m very much of a valence utilitarian. I\u2019ll gesture towards this book while explaining away any conflicting intutitions you might have with moral psychology.\r\n      * Dawkins blew my mind as a kid. Memes!!\r\n      * It\u2019s not a book, but I adore Scott Alexander\u2019s writing. Who doesn\u2019t though?\r\n* Other people! I love sharing my life with others. It gives me energy, gives colour to my life and helps me grow. \r\n   * I\u2019m really deeply interested in other people\u2019s inner worlds. It's been this way ever since I realised as a kid that other people have inner worlds, and I don't have direct access to them. You could say it's one of my special interests. I want to understand how it feels to be like you! Shifts in my own internal landscape have made me realise (and really internalise) the mind-boggling diversity in people\u2019s internal experience. And I probably haven\u2019t seen half of it yet! This is one of the biggest reasons I\u2019m looking for more people to love - I want to know people deeply, and be known deeply.\r\n   * Not to brag, but I\u2019m very empathetic. Perhaps to a fault. You can see how it would lead to this interest, right? And then it feeds back in a never ending connection-feedback-loop\u2026\r\n   * One of my big life projects is to build a community. Maybe you can become part of that?\r\n* Sounds a bit vague, but\u2026 Growing as a person? I feel like I\u2019ve lived many lives already. Started out in a small Hungarian town, working class family, difficult upbringing. Did well at school, moved out of the country alone. Building a life in Oslo now, studying maths, leading my local EA uni group and finding people to love. I\u2019m used to a pretty high insight/year ratio. If I feel stagnant I get restless. \r\n* People have told me I am \r\n   * very mature\r\n   * make them feel comfortable\r\n* Singing, dancing (I\u2019m not super coordinated but still enjoy it very much). I loove me a good psytrance rave every once in a while.\r\n* I\u2019ve found myself quite spiritual (and also somewhat of a psychonaut). Meditation and the rest. But can they factor the number? \r\n* Spending time in nature. Ghawd isn\u2019t it regulating! Sometimes I unironically hug trees. It just feels nice.\r\nDownsides of dating me\r\n* I\u2019m prone to anxiety and overcommitting. Both of those have become a lot better over my adult life, but I\u2019m still working on it. Is it just me or is uni actually way too much work?\r\n* Not vegan for complicated personal reasons I\u2019m happy to explain.\r\n* Although an intellectual spark is very important for me, I\u2019ve had an emotionally taxing few months, and not at my intellectual peak at the moment. What I need first and foremost is an emotional connection with a high level of intellectual compatibiltiy.\r\n* Currently I\u2019m located in Oslo. Statistically I would guess you aren\u2019t. I\u2019m not averse to moving eventually and can even travel a bit, but my budget is at the 22yo-student-working-class-moved-countries-by-herself level, so realistically we would have to get to know each other online. \r\nWhat am I looking for?\r\nNon-negotioable:\r\n* Friends, romace, anything in between or outside. We\u2019ll figure it out:)\r\n* Good communication is a must - I don\u2019t expect you to be perfect, but I can\u2019t be pulling the wagon all by myself. Had enough of those relationships already. Expect regular check-ins about how our relationship is going and how we would like to form it.\r\n* Polyamory. No hierarcy.\r\n* Intellectual connection. Playing around with ideas.\r\n* No kids for the next few years. 80% sure I\u2019ll never want any. (I don\u2019t mind if you have kids though!)\r\n* I don\u2019t care about your age. If you think you\u2019re too old for me, you probably aren\u2019t.\r\nPreferable:\r\n* I am very touchy-feely. Physical initmacy makes me happy, and it\u2019s a great way for me to build attachment. Cuddles, hugs, kisses, holding hands - if you\u2019re not a fan we\u2019re probably not a great match.\r\n* Softness and gentleness. Sensitivity and empathy.\r\n* Located near-ish Oslo so we can actually meet! \r\n* Ultimately I\u2019m looking for something long-term, living together or close to each other. I\u2019m in no rush though, and can imagine many other mutually enriching setups.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo-nos\r\n* Monogamy.\r\n* People who are a bit too type-A. I\u2019m not against ambition, I have plenty of it myself. But I want to get to know well-rounded people, with hobbies, experience in navigating interpersonal relationships, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact me:\r\nWrite an email to 2002anna.anna2002[at]gmail.com. Write \u201cDateMe\u201d in the title. Send your own doc if you have one:)\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, I\u2019m looking for someone to date, but if you just find me interesting as a friend and not as anything romantic I\u2019m still happy if you reach out. Especially if you have experience with polyamory! Please do reach out, I would really appreciate some poly wisdom in my life.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffIntro:\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! My name is Rich, short for Ullrich, and I\u2019m looking for someone to seriously date with the intention of marriage and family.  I\u2019m committed to staying on the west side of LA for the next two years at least, but my location flexibility opens up a bit after that. Aside from my day job, I\u2019m doing maintenance and renovations in exchange for greatly reduced rent, so I\u2019m using the opportunity to pay down student loans and save up for a down payment on a home. As such, although I\u2019m not cheap, I do prefer cooking and eating at home rather than going out frequently, I\u2019m content without luxury vacations, and keep travel to mostly hiking adventures and road trips for now, and so on.  Basically, budgeting wisely with an eye toward the future, while still trying to have at least a little adventure. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t believe in astrology, but if it pleases you, I\u2019m a Cancerian and a Water Pig. Which means, I guess, that I\u2019m very loving but I\u2019ll be sad and stubborn if you hurt my feelings?  Sounds about right. I\u2019m non-religious, something of a socialist, but have a nuanced enough outlook that I don\u2019t totally fit into any of the typical containers. I\u2019m an optimist most of the time, but not all of it.  I value kindness, humility, and serenity. If you're kind to your server, tip well, and clean up after yourself at a restaurant, if you always return your shopping cart, if you're considerate of others out in public, if you can appreciate the understated -- then you're my kind of person. Not that I eat out often. I\u2019ll take the stairs over the escalator or lift, and I\u2019m happy to park a little further back and walk, rather than spending an age searching for a better spot. Fair warning though - I seldom can remember where I parked. I would really appreciate a partner who could provide strength against that particular weakness. \r\n\r\n\r\n Oh, and here\u2019s what I look like, all 5\u201910\u201d of me. The first picture was taken in August of 2024, so these are recent:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet:\r\n\r\n\r\nI have what may be considered an extreme and rigid diet. I only eat meat. Over six years Carnivore for Health - ask me about it! Besides the first year of pandemic, when I was drinking for something to do. Bad idea. I'm still paying for that, but it's further evidence that I'm on the right path now. I'm very passionate about holistic health through diet, and for the benefits to overall human health and to the environment from eating a ruminant-based diet. It's important to me and I don't expect my partner to be a carnivore too, but I won't be able to share dessert or have just one bite of this or that. In a relationship I would at least want someone into holistic diet, sustainability, and interested in a carb conscious lifestyle both for us and for any potential children. I realize that this will raise a lot of questions, but it\u2019s not something I need to frequently talk about, so if you want to know more, I\u2019ve provided more detail about this at the end of this document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinued vvv\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily:\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have a relationship with my family. The silver lining here is that with me, you wouldn't have to worry about any in-laws in the picture. I'm happy with where I am and I've done a fair amount of self-work and therapy so I'm truly okay here - this information is for you. Since I have no ties to my family, I am open to taking my wife's last name when I get married again, provided it is her own name and not an ex husband's. And if she's not interested in that, perhaps she can help me pick out a new last name together. I am divorced (2005-2016, no kids), and moved to California to start over eight years ago. \r\n\r\nI grew up in a large Italian-American family, heavy emphasis on family, so it\u2019s been a bit dissociating being so disconnected from mine, but it was a choice I made along with input from my therapist, and I\u2019ve been happy. Still, I\u2019d be happy to become a part of my partner\u2019s family, and in time, build our own.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoals/Background:\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my other short term goals is to go back to school. I'm thankful that my job has been stable during these times, but I want to flesh out a path that's a little bit more meaningful. I currently only have an associate's degree. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time I was in a dual Bachelors-Masters program for Dietetics at Eastern Michigan University, and after I became a practicing dietitian I intended to start studying endocrinology. I've always been deeply moved and fascinated by the way what we consume affects our hormonal chemistry and in turn our metabolic health. I've taken more credits over the years than most people who do have master's degrees. But while I was in the middle of that dietetics program, my father passed away, I put a pause on school to deal with the fallout, and I wound up depressed, divorced, and moving to California to start over. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy original plan was to finish school once I had my California residency, but I wound up with a decent career and just went with it, shifting my focus instead on trying to meet somebody to settle down and start a family with. But, a handful of relationships that didn't work out later, I find my career in a place where I'd really like to take the next step and move up so I'm thinking it's about time to finally get serious about going back to school. I always figured that I would finish education and career moves after I settled down with somebody. I realize it may not be the right priority, but it's the way my brain is wired. A lot of things in life just seem easier when you're connected with somebody special. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt this juncture I need to actively start working on both. I'd love to meet my forever person while at the same time continuing to advance myself.\r\n\r\n\r\ncontinued vvv\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to a relationship I'm interested in finding someone who would like to share a carb conscious lifestyle, who likes occasional hikes, and shares passions in social justice, sustainability, kindness, and generally making choices that will help people. Maybe we can go clean a beach up early morning, then walk along it holding hands? \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also very passionate - touch and quality time are my love languages - I want a slow burn before intimacy, but once we\u2019re there, I like to make out slow and sensually, and go down on my partner frequently, and I'm big on cuddling and aftercare. I'm happy with your natural humanity and I don't care whether you shave or put on makeup. We can curl up and I'll play with your hair while we whisper silly things to each other. We can wake up in each other\u2019s arms and kiss good morning. I think it's very sensual and erotic to be with someone who is comfortable enough to be a natural human being around me. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome combination of occasional hikes and nature walks, lazy nights watching a romcom or playing boardgames, cute walks through downtowns, playing with puppies, thrift shopping, cooking together and dancing in the kitchen, having deep conversations about the world around us, challenging each other to learn and grow, and sharing values of curiosity, kindness, compassion, and exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther quirks\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not much of a gamer, but after work sometimes I like to unwind by playing Minecraft for a little bit. I\u2019m a very silly, happy go lucky person. One moment I can be serious and the next I can be doing a gollum impression or thinking up a ridiculous pun. While my music taste is varied and eclectic (the first CD I ever bought with my own money was Best of the Village People!) -  I often don\u2019t put on music. I enjoy the quiet.  I\u2019ve had my puppy for six months now and she still hasn\u2019t got a name\u2026 I\u2019ve tried on many names, but nothing has stuck so far. I\u2019m left-handed, a bit of a nerd, and I enjoy writing sonnets and other poetry.  For years I did an online writing roleplay pretending to be someone living in 15th century Europe, just writing stories with others from around the world.  I enjoy hikes, but I\u2019m just as happy playing board games or curling up to watch a Ghibli flick.  I like romantic comedies, broadway musicals, Lord of the Rings, and I\u2019d love to go to the opera with someone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d like to get in touch, whether as a friend or potentially something more, please reach out! You can find me on instagram @xyphratl (tw: plenty of pictures of meat), or shoot an email to xyphratl@gmail.com . Let me know you found me here! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about my all-meat diet:\r\n\r\n\r\nAs promised, some more information for the morbidly curious:\r\n\r\n\r\nI prefer cooking and eating at home over going out, and I'll happily cook for others, even dishes that I won't personally eat. I don't consider myself a picky eater because I like almost everything (except artichokes... I'm a bad Italian-American); I just choose not to eat it for health purposes. That said, I'm not difficult to go out with. I can find something at almost any restaurant, or happily have a sparkling water or cup of tea while others enjoy ramen or dessert. I'm definitely at least ketogenic for life, and possibly carnivore for life. \r\n\r\n\r\nI believe this is both optimal human nutrition, and beneficial to the environment at large. When a field of grains is harvested, countless birds, rodents, and other bugs and critters are killed. But from just one cow, you can eat for nearly an entire year. Ranches that practice regenerative ranching, such as White Oak Pastures, can actually have a carbon negative effect, reverse desertification, and be a tool to fight against climate change. And chances are, when you eat a steak, its source is fewer than 50 miles from where you're sitting. On the other hand, monocrop agriculture is terrible for the planet, creates runoff crises, extreme water use, depletes soil, and the food miles on processed grains and produce are astronomical. And besides, vegans fart more than cows do anyway. That's not just a quip. Studies show that vegans flatulate seven times more than someone on a standard American diet. And people on a carnivore diet do it seldomly altogether. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy LDL cholesterol is \"high\" as you might expect. I'm okay with this. My triglycerides are extremely low and I still have what's considered a great ratio. Beyond this, I don't consider a high cholesterol to be a negative. Although I'm pro-vaccine, there is also room for natural human immunity. LDL cholesterol transports vitamins through the bloodstream and can also engulf pathogens and foreign substances much like a neutrophil. We've been pushing low cholesterol since the 1950s and metabolic disease has skyrocketed since... it's no wonder natural human immunity isn't as robust as it should be. Unless I meet my demise by some kind of violent or accidental end, I'm going to outlive all the people taking statins and eating low-fat diets. My cognitive function will also outlast the vast majority of theirs. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information I invite you to check out The Cholesterol Code, or the work of Mary Enig on seed oils, or Sally Norton on oxalates, or Gary Taubes, Judy Cho, Nina Teicholz, doctors Jason Fung, Shawn Baker, Anthony Chaffee, Ken Berry, Lisa Wiedeman, Robert Kiltz, Paul Saladino... and more! With all of that being said, carnivore is my diet, but not my lifestyle or identity. It's important for my partner to know and understand where I am coming from and what I value, and I've written all of this because I understand that most people will have many questions, but it's not really something that I'll constantly be talking about.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffPip Moss - Date Me Doc\r\n* Age: 34\r\n* Height: 5\u20196\u201d\r\n* Occupation: Solicitor \r\n* Location: London, UK.\r\n* Looking for: Women, ideally long term relationship but open to starting and seeing where we get to. Not fussed on mechanics of relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Top priorities:\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Significant Overlap of Values. We don\u2019t have to agree on everything but I want to be able to wake up and spend a bit of every day helping you achieve your goals and feel good about that.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Intellectual Curiosity. I like knowing things, from trivia to social research, and I like people telling me things. I\u2019ll enjoy learning new things for the rest of my life and it would probably be good if you did too because I\u2019ll want to talk about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * General Zest for Life: I like my calendar being fairly full of things to do, be they attending talks or trying a new type of exercise. I have main hobbies but am always up for trying something new. I\u2019d really value someone pushing me in new directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Clear Communication. I\u2019m a direct communicator and can only really be like that. I work hard to be direct, not abrasive, but I\u2019m not great at reading between the lines. I\u2019m very honest (but not tactless) and take honesty fairly seriously, which friends and family mostly really like.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Independence. I want a partner, and a partnership, rather than someone to completely merge lives with until we are practically one person. I want to do lots of things with you but wouldn\u2019t expect you to curtail having a life and projects outside of \u2018Us\u2019 and I\u2019d want that balance for myself too.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Non-Negotiables:\r\n   * I don\u2019t want kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I can\u2019t bear the smell of tobacco. Am not much better with cannabis though if you never smoked where we lived I could maybe manage.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Slightly Negotiables:\r\n   * I\u2019m a pretty committed urbanite. I\u2019ve lived in London and Manchester, and might live in other cities in the future but really value living centrally and the lifestyle that allows.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I\u2019m not religious or a believer in the supernatural, and while I don\u2019t mind if you are I am unlikely to ever buy-in and share that beyond joining festivals to be supportive/share experiences.\r\n\t* My Main Hobbies: \r\n\r\n\r\n   * Bouldering, Running, Obstacle Course Running. Two years ago I tried bouldering and I\u2019ve fallen into a fitness lifestyle since then. I climb twice a week, run a similar amount, and am working towards the London Marathon in 2026. Allez!\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Cooking. I cook from scratch almost everything I eat and like expanding my repertoire. Currently trying different mapo tofu and seitan recipes as I become \u2018Pesc-an\u2019 (Vegan, plus fish). Got a great vegan brownie recipe. Love cooking for friends and family, and would love to cook for a partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Cat lover. Currently sharing my house (as well as a lodger) with my cat Serral.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Random research online. From perusing Wikipedia (then double-checking it) to reading government reports, I like knowing more about the world. I\u2019m the kind of person who will fact check myself online. I try to live an evidence-based life and want a data-driven world.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Visiting Museums/Galleries/Places of Interest/Classical Music Performances. No particular theme as to where, I just like seeing friends at somewhere more interesting than a coffee shop if we can. What else is life in London for? Most recent trip: Freemasons Hall. Beautiful but left me with more questions than answers!\r\n   *    * Political Gambling. I\u2019ve been betting on elections since I was 20, with a good record. I sometimes write about it. But I\u2019m an obsessive, not an addict. I even have the spreadsheets to prove it\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Board Games. Also another great way to spend time with friends. I\u2019m not hyper-competitive but do tend to do a bit of pre-research and want to give a good account of myself. OK maybe I am competitive, but I\u2019m a pretty good loser.\r\n\t* Values/Personality (This is not a checklist of things you have to be):\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I value agency and intentionality, in myself and others. I fear too many people too much of the time make decisions passively, by default or the path of least resistance. I want to live deliberately. I get frustrated by adults not taking accountability for their lives and I want to be held accountable for mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Introverted but outgoing in a comfortable environment. I like a busy social life, just not so open to events with heavy drinking or loud music.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Organised. I believe in systems. I meal plan, I track my freezer contents in Excel, I check my net worth quarterly, I often instigate and co-ordinate social plans in my friendship groups. I even have a spreadsheet for when I last saw each of my friends so I don\u2019t forget someone for too long (the name turns red after 90 days). They laughed, but then half of them asked me for the template.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * High Decoupler. I don\u2019t take disagreement personally and am happy to discuss almost anything in a dispassionate way. I try to be sensitive to other people\u2019s discomfort, but I\u2019m rarely unwilling to answer a personal question or consider an idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Environmentalist. I cycle most journeys if I\u2019m not on the Tube and I don\u2019t fly for leisure at the moment (though I\u2019d be open to, especially if I found some effective offsets). I\u2019m also a YIMBY and a New Urbanist. Don\u2019t own a car, but can drive and would get one if it made sense for my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Effective Altruist. By which I mean I donate 8% of my income (and growing) to effective charities and generally buy-in to the concept.\r\n\tSome more photos of me:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking the most of the period Serral was light enough to hold up on one arm. I actually have a shirtless version of this from another day but that felt tacky to share unprompted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Parkrun photo with two friends who got me into running and whom I owe many thanks for that and much besides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt turns out there is such a thing as vegan clotted cream. And it\u2019s good!",

In a nutshell, I\u2019m trying to invent math that would enable methods of designing artificial intelligence systems which are much more responsible than how it\u2019s done today. And, it\u2019s very important to me: not just a job, but a life calling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u269b\ufe0fAs you might have guessed from the above, I\u2019m a huge nerd. Math, computer science and physics are areas in which I have professional knowledge. I also know a little about history and analytic philosophy, and enjoy nerding out about virtually any intellectual topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf0dSome properties of my world-view: I\u2019m an atheist, transhumanist, vegan. Politically I\u2019m a centrish liberal (I strongly support personal freedoms and democracy guardrails, dislike collectivism and traditionalism).\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I enjoy in my free time:\r\n* \ud83d\udcda Reading, mostly scifi and fantasy, with a special soft spot for romance novels \ud83d\udc98. Favorite writers include Naomi Novik, Kate Elliot, Lois McMaster Bujold, Brandon Sanderson, Greg Egan and Sharon Shinn.\r\n* \ud83c\udfb2 Playing board games, even though I\u2019m a sore loser.\r\n* \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Tabletop RPG, although I never manage to find a group that sticks together for long.\r\n* \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Art galleries, both classic and modern.\r\n* \ud83c\udfad Theatre. I haven\u2019t seen many plays, but recently I enjoy it a lot.\r\n* \ud83c\udfb5 Listening to music, of almost any genre besides extreme metal. Some artists I like: Zaz, Nightwish, Beth Hart, Leonard Cohen, Rona Kenan, Muse.\r\n* \ud83c\udf06 Walking around cities with good vibes or beautiful architecture (in particular, I love the old European cities).\r\n* \ud83d\udc60 Shopping with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc8dI've been married to my love and life-partner Marcus since 2021 (and we\u2019ve been poly from the start).

Naturally, these will usually take some time to develop.\r\n* \ud83d\udd70\ufe0fI\u2019m open to secondary relationships of any intensity, anything between seeing each other multiple times a week to meeting once in a blue moon.\r\n* \u2604\ufe0fIf you live not in Israel it will by necessity be a comet (i.e. meeting once in a blue moon).\r\n* \ud83e\udd84I also don\u2019t mind dating a couple, but once again, only if it\u2019s a relationship that\u2019s much more than just sex.\r\n* \ud83d\udda4BDSM is a lovely bonus (I\u2019m a sub).\r\nMore Pics",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffhello, i\u2019m e (not my real name but it is suitable as a pseudonym) from texas (probably). i am 27 going on 28. i love competing in niche games primarily but i also love film and write about it occasionally. traveling to see my friends all over the world is typically where my money goes. it used to go to archive fashion but i have grown satisfied with my wardrobe and dissatisfied with spending my money on products. i don't buy anything physical besides clothes, food, and hygiene products. i am an antinatalist. i am a non-denominational leftist. i am generally speaking quite happy in my day to day as there are many things i find fulfilling.\r\n\r\n\r\ni am not posting photos of myself. this is not due to insecurity of my appearance (which i have learned to more or less live with) but because i don't value physical attraction in relationships and it's not something i care to maximize for myself. it also feels somewhat dishonest to work on my physical appearance when i have so much work to do on myself in other departments. i also want to limit pictures of myself on the internet to the best of my abilities, but i can of course send them directly if you interested.\r\n\r\n\r\nlikes and dislikes\r\n\r\n\r\nlikes:\r\n\r\n\r\ncompeting (ask me about which games if you're interested)\r\nwatching films (my favorite director is jacques rivette)\r\nwearing a nice outfit out\r\nfinding a good clothing deal\r\nhanging out with friends\r\nhelping my friends when they need help\r\nnice food\r\ntraveling to see friends\r\nnoise music, along with other kinds sometimes\r\nlearning\r\ntutoring math\r\nbouldering (even though i am bad at it)\r\n\r\n\r\ndislikes:\r\n\r\n\r\ndating (i prefer talking online)\r\nflirting (i will not flirt with you; it's nothing personal)\r\ndancing\r\nsex work (i have no beef with sex workers of course and would not object to dating one)\r\nbigotry\r\nvoting\r\nmachine washing clothing\r\ndriving \r\ndoing poorly in tournaments\r\nsports (i am interested in sports statistics however)\r\nnostalgia as a concept\r\nnormie designer bags\r\n\r\n\r\ni dislike biographies that try to sell the reader on the author; i find myself too insecure about my potential narcissistic traits to write about this. some people find me funny and intelligent, some people find me insufferable and dim; who knows what you will find me? i have nothing intrinsically positive to say about myself.\r\n\r\n\r\ni am very online and most my humor comes from this. i make okay money (from a boring job - you can ask about it if you\u2019d like) but not enough to support a partner, something i feel extremely guilty about. i would prefer a long distance relationship as that is what is most familiar to me, but i am open to other possibilities. i am monogamous. one \"relationship\" setup that i wouldn't mind is a strictly platonic marriage in which i provide access to living in the US and, in exchange, i gain access to my spouse's insurance which allows me to retire early. an ideal romantic relationship would involve myself and my partner lifting each other up and trying to bring out the best in each other, and i think it would be most advantageous if we had at least one or two things in common if that is the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nas i mentioned earlier i don't find physical appearance important. i am also unconcerned with how much my partner makes, unless they are dependent upon me for survival which i don't know if i can guarantee that on my current income. you can contact me via discord at souljaboytellemdotcom if you'd like to talk - i am also open to just making new friends of course, if your primary takeaway is \"this guy sounds insane but i would like to talk about film and clothing with him.\" in any case i hope you have a nice day and find what you are pursuing : ) .",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate or be friends with me doc\r\nSo, tell me about yourself\u2026\r\nSure. I\u2019ve broken this down into work & purpose, family & community, relationship leanings, joy, food, location, and what I look like. \r\nWork & purpose\r\nI work as a user researcher and self defence instructor. My research mostly informs public service and policy but I research anything interesting e.g. DIY gene editing tools, bike paths, storm response systems (this is starting to sound like a pitch\u2026)\r\n \r\nI also run an Empowerment Self Defence charity. We offer survivors of violence and people at risk of abuse workshops to harness their own strength, practise nervous system regulation, and have fun and thrive while learning self defence skills.  \r\nFamily & community \r\nFamily & community are priorities for me. I listed my work initiatives first because it\u2019s where I\u2019ve put most of my energy in the past without quite realising I was doing it. Recently, I've resolved to intentionally cultivate community and create family, rather than assume this will all work out with minimal intervention on my part. I\u2019d love to create a relationship with a community around it; a relationship that is in itself a family and that also generates more family in some form.  \r\nRelationship leanings\r\nI\u2019m into monogamous relationships, ones that are co-located, and I\u2019d love to be in a relationship that feels like a great team.  \r\nJoy\r\nThis is a recent focus. I can\u2019t think of a lot to say about it other than: why not make a point of generating and savouring it?\r\nFood\r\nYes. Please. Ideally vegetables. Moderate drinker, more of a savourer than a guzzler. Sweet tooth problem (cake I can guzzle for some reason?) \r\nLocation\r\nUK, London, Hackney. \r\nAre you open to relocating?\r\nI can imagine doing this under some circumstances, and definitely know how to. Yet after moving back and forth across 3 continents for lots of my adult life, I\u2019m trying something newish (to me): staying in one place, becoming rooted. \r\n\r\n\r\nI also think I\u2019ve exceeded the threshold of how many long distance relationships are sensible to have in one lifetime, so best if a partner and I live in roughly the same place.\r\nWhat are you looking for in a partner?\r\nQualities I deeply appreciate include: kindness, curiosity, a general sense of presence, attentiveness, introspective skills, interest in bodies, not just in how they look but in how they are, and how they connect, co-regulation (\u2190 which is more of a relational than individual attribute, but such a magic thing that I think worth mentioning.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to be and to be with someone we\u2019d all want on a team; someone resourced, with skills and perspective to bring to the mix, someone who values learning and growth, someone who has my back as I have theirs. \r\nWhat do you think a relationship even is?\r\nI think of a relationship as a creation; something we cultivate intentionally, consciously, caringly; something we feel worthwhile to maintain and nurture even when that takes a little effort after the butterflies stop fluttering all the time. \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love to create a relationship that changes and expands as we do; that forms a secure ground from which we can step out into the world, have rich experiences, change, grow, and bring those changes and that growth back to each other and watch them enrich our relationship. \r\n\r\n\r\nI also think of it as bowls of soup on the couch in winter, watching each other's bags at the train station so we don\u2019t have to lug them to the toilet, arguing well, giggles, surprises, whispers, building community and creating some form of family incl. children, dogs, neighbours, friends, or a subset of these.\r\nCan we be (\u2018just\u2019) friends?\r\nIf we\u2019re compatible as friends, yes please. I cherish friendship and have space and time for new friends. \r\nWhat do you and your world look like? \r\nHere are some photos. The most typical moments I don\u2019t have photos of, so these ones below aren\u2019t a representative sample. They\u2019re all reasonably recent and relevant though.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI sit in a chair lots for work but like to move so I practise and sometimes teach chair yoga\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\nI lived on a boat for a while, and started to find land weirdly rigid\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nOne of my favourite little friends and me\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLip syncing to Whitney Houston for a pandemic-era work zoom flash mob (sparkly shirt courtesy of downstairs neighbour)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne of my besties and me on a cold UK beach walk \r\n\t  \r\n\r\nThis is an improv scene about a toothache \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA hackathon about improving outcomes for violence survivors with trauma-informed self defence \r\n\tHow can I get in touch?\r\nSend me a line here :)",

    ProfileText: "Skip to content\nHome\nWhere is my Soulmate?\nI am trying to find the girl who I am most similar to/is best for me. Maybe you are her, you know her, or you know someone who knows her.\nTakes 2 minutes to read. Photographs are at the bottom.\nI am somewhat of a reserved person, so to put myself out here, publicly, is not something I want to do. If you know a better way, let me know.\nI am an only child of a single mother, who had me while still attending college.\nA lot of my childhood was spent listening to classic rock and watching Nick at Nite sitcoms.\nI lived a grunge rock teenage life: skateboarding, drugs, promiscuity, partying, and playing in a band.\nNow, I\u2019m a writer, working on my second book \u201cThe Depth of Middleclass Sorrow: a comedy\u201d. My first novella \u201cTangled Shadows\u201d is very important to me, and I hope it is significant to my future girlfriend too.\nThe best description of my personality is sincere, and analytic.\nI try to always be as kind and considerate as possible, though I was not always this way (I used to be an obnoxious, terrible person). I am an extremely rational person, but I am also a very emotional, romantic, and adventurous person.\nI have been called \u201cas funny as Eddie Murphy\u201d.\nFor some time, I was a dedicated criminal. I had a crush on a woman who liked gangsters, so I ended up a felon (car theft), if she liked doctors: I would have a medical degree. I wanted to be a guerrilla soldier, but it is probably better that I was trying to rob jewelry stores, instead of making car bombs. Anyway, now, I maybe want to repair electrical appliances and be a postal/agricultural worker. I\u2019ve worked mostly in movie theaters and retail.\nEthno-culturally, I am: IrishAmerican-Catholic, from north of Chicago. Also, genetically, but not culturally, I am a quarter Mexican which is where I get my tan complexion from.\nI spend most of my time thinking about: philosophy, science, religion, mysticism, politics,\u00a0culture, art, psychoanalysis, math,\u00a0history, sociology, anthropology, etc., and want someone with to have long, interesting discussions.\nMy main hobbies are biking, wall tennis, driving fast, writing, going to museums and concerts, playing cards, trivia, meditating, drinking, drugs, and sunbathing.\nRandom things I want to do: study history and vocabulary, lose 25 pounds/get in shape, work on craft/science/art projects, go to: Scotland, Mexico, Italy, Spain, learn a trade, learn some Welsh (I can speak some Spanish).\nI used to look down on internet dating, because it was not the traditional way people met, but now: I see it as exceedingly more practical than traditional dating, and it can be romantic too.\nBefore I would just date the first woman I met who I was interested in, and they did not work out, so I believe we should all try to find our factual best romantic match (the person most similar to us). It is equally important who you dont date, as who you do date, as there is only 1 person most similar to yourself.\nI have talked a lot about myself, but I am not an egocentric person. I will be at least equally interested, if not, mostly likely more interested in you (my future partner), than myself.\nBeware: if you become my girlfriend, you will be the most important person to me: I will sincerely care for you, and I will want to spend most of my time with you.\nI apologize for any typos or errors, I went to American public school.\nTo write, my email is:\nxavierjayrichards@aol.com\nIf you want to know the movies, music, books, and T.V. shows I like, ask me, I have a long list: I took down to make it quicker to read.\nP.S.\nIt is a 100% fact that there is a person who is most similar or compatible to you. It is like saying there must be a biggest rock somewhere, excuse the inelegant analogy, so to say the soulmate is real, but I prefer the term \u201ctrue love\u201d or \u201cbest romantic match\u201d. Also, there is another idea I have: the worst romantic match: the person least compatible to you, also there is the second best romantic match, which is not the soulmate. So if you meet someone by randomness: there is a 1 in 8 billion chance, they are the person most similar to you.\nI wish there was a website/app where you could search: Polish, middle child, heavy metal, and find all the people like you, but that has yet to exist. Please someone make it. For now dating apps are the same as meeting someone randomly on the sidewalk.\nI should also say: I don\u2019t want children, but I am open to possibly dating someone who has children. Like most people, I went through a phase of wanting to have children. Nor do I want pets, though I am good with animals, and had cats, a dog, and fish growing up: I don\u2019t want the responsibility, and I don\u2019t like the hair and waste of animals.\nThe woman most similar to myself 100% factually has to exist, she has: a name, birthday, hometown, and hair color. As I cannot just guess from thin air who she is, otherwise I would just go talk to her.\nYou can ask me anything, and I will try to be as honest as I can.\nI did not say this anywhere: I was born in 1991.\nThank you, very much, for reading. Maybe I know your best romantic match.\nShare if you would.\nI hope everyone has happiness, choices, wisdom, good fortune, and finds their best romantic match, so on and such. And please always try to be as kind and considerate as possible.\nLoading Comments...\nWrite a Comment...\nEmail (Required)\nName (Required)\nWebsite",

I read like 20 articles a day and skim a hundred more, when they come in through my lovingly curated RSS feed reader which has been my baby for over a decade. Once or twice a month I'll work through an actual book as well [1], but not as often as I\u2019ll paw through ao3 for longfic.\r\n* The ACX/rationality meetups organizer for my area (I also moonlight as the EA meetups organizer occasionally, and on rare occasions I help out with meetups in other cities). It brings me joy to connect to lots of cool, like minded people, and to connect them to each other.\r\n* Deeply interested in complex projects that take time and cleverness and skill \u2014 cultivating long lasting friendships and communities, getting to truly know a city and putting roots down, developing deep expertise in a special interest topic, building out a personal knowledge system, supporting loved ones and watching them grow into increasingly better versions of themselves over the course of decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] highlights from a recent quarter; fairly representative\r\n* Detransition Baby, Torrey Peters\r\n* Engineering Play, Mizuko Ito\r\n* Meditations on Violence, Rory Miller\r\n* Troubled,  Rob Henderson\r\n* Art in the After-Culture, Ben Davis\r\n* The Complete Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde, Oscar Wilde\r\n* All Fours, Miranda July\r\n* Middlemarch, George Eliot\r\n________________\r\nAbout Me\r\nBasics\r\nGender: cis female\r\nAge: 28\r\nSexuality: very gay [2]\r\nCurrent location: Waterloo, Ontario\r\nJob: Running a microceleb\u2019s vanity think-tank (it\u2019s a good think-tank, your honor.)\r\nKids: maybe [3]\r\nSeeking: a long term monogamous/primary relationship [4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] noting explicitly that I'm fine with dating transfem and NB people.\r\n[3] My mom gets to take her cool adult children to brunch and exchange gossip and life tips with them, and I want that for me when I'm her age. Also, see bullet point about long complex projects \u2014 that applies to raising kids as well. But those seem like not the best reasons to have a kid? \u2190 But this also sounds like a bad reason to not have kids? But in addition I'm scared that it will go horribly wrong, which it can in many many ways (death or severe disability, I turn out to have an awful temperament for child rearing, kid just inexplicably ends up being a total asshole addicted to heroin). It\u2019s a bit of a wash.\r\n[4] I've been weakly intrigued by poly/open relationships for a pretty long time, but all of my past relationships have been monogamous. I can't guarantee that non-monog relationships will work for me in practice, but I'm open to trying it out for unusually compatible folks.\r\nPotential Dealbreakers for Normal People\r\n* Can't co-sleep more than half of the time, it wrecks my sleep quality :(\r\n* Severe cat allergy \u2014 either Mittens goes or I do\r\n* Passenger princess (can't drive); need to live by at least one transit line\r\n* Hard requirement for curtains open and bright overhead lights on during the daytime. Sorry gamers\r\n* I donate 10% of my income to charity every year, this is extra non-negotiable\r\nAdditional Potential Dealbreakers for People In the Adjacency\r\n* I love having lots of physical things, so a nomadic/minimalist lifestyle isn't going to cut it for me (though this definitely doesn\u2019t rule out extended travel). I need a homebase with space for my PC setup and my  craft supplies and my bookshelves and ideally a worktable and my lumenators and framed art pieces on all of the walls... you get the idea.\r\n* I\u2019m kind of tired of the intellectual immune response towards social justice ideology; yeah it got excessive but I see the response as a devastating case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Like, I find much of pronatalism discourse intolerable because in many ways they're reinventing wheels that feminists have solidly established and were having sophisticated debates about by the late 70s, and this makes me want to turn into the jonker.\r\n* I am only into a few board games and am kind of an art snob about video games, and for games in general I have zero competitiveness drive or desire to improve. The only games I want to git gud at are the infinite ones \ud83d\ude0e\r\n\r\n\r\nRead on if your deal has not been broken! For this doc I have chosen a strategy of highlighting my most polarizing traits upfront; I swear I also have straightforwardly good traits as well :P\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAbout You\r\n\r\n\r\n* Not a guy\r\n* Late 20s to early 30s\r\n* Ideally, like, medium agency? I like people who have thought about what they want and are taking actions towards getting it, but I don't particularly want to date a workaholic or someone who doesn't have time for a rich, fulfilling personal life.\r\n* Fun to chat with \u2014 at least two of smart, observant, funny, and good at ~texting, but more is better :)\r\n* This is a really good description of how I feel about the world, and I need it to also be what you feel, or at least for you to have a sense of the world that's compatible with it. Be surprised and dazzled and have your heart broken about the world with me.\r\n* Meets generic \u201cgood partner\u201d requirements\r\n* Reasonably clean. We can't hang if you don't clean your bathroom or wash your sheets regularly\r\n* Physically active. I don't derive much joy from exercise but I do it regularly, and I suspect that having a partner that does not exercise will make me much more likely to fall off, and that would, you know, shorten my lifespan by many years, and that seems bad\r\n* Emotionally aware, communicates well, and is committed to improving the relationship over time through ongoing communication. I don\u2019t need you to be an NVC master or anything like that, but I need you to make an honest effort, and for your honest effort to be not terrible.\r\n________________\r\nAbout Us\r\n\r\n\r\nRecipe For Happiness Khaborovsk Or Anyplace\r\n Lawrence Ferlinghetti\r\nOne grand boulevard with trees\r\nwith one grand cafe in sun\r\nwith strong black coffee in very small cups.\r\nOne not necessarily very beautiful\r\nman or woman who loves you.\r\nOne fine day.\r\nthis could be us!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want a partner in crime! I want to be egged on to start cool scary projects and I want to egg you on as well. I want us to host a hundred splendid dinner parties and do the washing up together afterwards while we bask in the success and discuss what we can do better next time. I want to go with you to art museums all over the world and plagiarize the pieces that are particularly good for our living room wall (I\u2019m starting to develop a system for that).\r\n\r\n\r\nI want someone to go to the movies and late night snack runs with. I want someone beside me on the couch while we read our separate books or watch the next episode of a show together or plot our next big thing together in a google doc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, obviously, rushing the dating process would be the opposite of useful here, but I'm also excited about the big, slow things: to see what kind of doors open, what kind of projects we can take on, and how much we can change each other; year by year, decade by decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this sort of thing sounds interesting to you, shoot me an email and let\u2019s see if we click: hi at jenn dot site. \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAppendix 1: Current Projects\r\nCommunity Building\r\n* I run weekly meetups for rationalists. I love designing meetups and I love running them and I love being surrounded by the kind of people who don't blink twice at having to do readings to show up to a meetup for discussing the readings. I want to keep poking at this group rationality thing, and in the meantime derive a regular dose of healthy intellectual stimulation.\r\n* Occasionally I'll throw in a wildcard meetup \u2014 we'll go see a theatre production or I'll run authentic relating games or I'll pull out some classic experiment for us to try to reproduce (we generally fail) or I'll make everyone put on blindfolds. I don't understand why more people aren't just absolutely delighted by the fact that they can throw incredibly weird parties purely for the sake of putting their friends in Situations. I try to take full advantage of this as much as I can.\r\n* I'm interested in building up something that lasts, and something that helps out the folks in it emotionally and materially. It's fortunate that this basically starts happening by default if you regularly see the same goobers with enough frequency. But you can always push it further along strategically as well.\r\nSkilling Up/Increasing Agency\r\n* Careers-wise, I\u2019m currently focused on gaining generalist experience around all things involved in creating and running an organization. One of these days I'll find a cause area I have comparative advantage in and like, found an org about it, but I don't expect it to be any time soon; I love my current job!\r\n* I've been using LLMs a bunch, mostly because it's fun, partially because I think if jobs still exist in 20 years it'll be good to say that I have 20 years of experience with them, and partially because they're enabling me to do a lot more cool stuff and I'm curious to see how far I can push that. Like, I don't know how to code [5] but now I can make websites anyways! How cool is that :D\r\n* I tinker with personal knowledge management systems to figure out what's the best way of retaining all the stuff that I read. In my teens to early 20s I used Evernote, but it's only ever gotten worse so I moved away in the late 2010s. I currently have a tiny gem of an obsidian vault, designed to roughly Matuschakian specifications, but I wonder if it would be better on the whole if I made a higher quantity of worse, lower effort notes.\r\nDeveloping Aesthetics\r\n* I visit a lot of modern art museums, and whenever I visit a new city that's what I make a beeline for. I love modern art museums \u2014 most of the work in them is crap, but there will always be a few pieces that blow me out of the water, more than any classical art piece. Yves Klein, Meret Oppenheim, and Mark Tansey are some of my favourite artists.\r\n* Tweaking my personal style! I'm trying to grow it in a slightly more masc and formal direction currently. I have Strong Opinions about some fashion bloggers. I am currently on the hunt for the perfect pair of loafers. I secured some weejuns, now I\u2019m looking for some nice tailored button ups.\r\n* Practicing decorative arts \u2014 I do some cross stitch, embroidery, sashiko, sewing, and crochet. It's fun, I like customizing my belongings, and it's nice to be able to make tiny gifts for my friends on a whim.\r\n* Dabbling a bit in digital art, just to create some rationality merch that I am actually willing to wear on my body. That's been going pretty okay, and it's great that Midjourney can generate me infinite reference photos.\r\n* Trying to get into movies more. It's a neat art form. I\u2019m especially into documentaries about very specific people or events that I wouldn\u2019t otherwise know about unless I was in some sort of specific subculture, such as Crumb (1994) and Battle at Versailles (2016); if you have recs please send them my way!!!\r\nLetting the soft animal of my body love what it loves\r\n* Splurging on a big bag of jumbo cherries every week when it's in season\r\n* Stopping frequently on bike trips when the clouds are dramatic, just to look my fill\r\n* Reacquainting myself with the nu-metal bands that I loved in middle school. This is the good shit.\r\n* Going through the IGF finalists every year and picking up the games that I think I might love.\r\n* Cycling through a dozen casual hobbies unrepentantly\r\n* A very specific genre of poetry that makes me feel fuzzy inside. This poem\u2019s my favourite.\r\n* Letting myself dance even though I have zero coordination and bodily awareness. I was once called \u201cthe wiggliest dancer at the rave\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] I have the tiniest bit of experience with HTML and CSS from playing Neopets a bunch in third grade, but literally nothing more than that\r\n________________\r\nAppendix 2: Additional Pictures of Me\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMe and the gang rejecting a terrible message in an art museum; me in a cardigan I made\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMost of my pics of myself are like these ones, taken after I've corralled my friends into taking a nice picture to celebrate and mark just being together. I'm not big on social media, but I figure the us-es of 2040 would appreciate these little tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nA few miscellaneous shots.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAppendix 3: Testimonial\r\n\r\n\r\nJenn and I dated through university and remain good friends to this day. Sometimes I think about how I've changed and grown in that time, and many threads that I'm proud of trace right back to her. It was genuinely transformative to spend a few years experiencing Jenn's unique blend of compassion, intelligence, and will to point those things at making the world a better place.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomehow she low-key pulled this on me even though we were just having an enjoyable time cuddling, playing various games into the wee hours of the morning, throwing interesting parties for our friends, slinging internet longform at each other, and just generally having a great time. I'm still not sure how she managed that one.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, we were young and dumb then, and she's even cooler now somehow.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, 10/10, great person, would recommend deliberately spending a lot of time around.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDave  \r\nSan Diego, California\r\ndavidabarak@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been divorced since March, 2021, and I'm thankful that it was a drama-free event. My ex-wife is a good woman but we just drifted apart. I've done a lot of work on myself since then, and I have a good handle on the things I did wrong. If I get a second chance at love, I'll know how to make it work.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the divorce and my retirement that followed soon after, I really began to examine my life. It turns out I'm not the center of the universe after all! Okay, I wasn't really that self-centered, but I did realize that my greatest rewards come from service to others, whether it's working to be a better partner and friend, volunteering, or just doing simple things that might make someone's day just a little nicer. Compassion, kindness, generosity, awareness, gratitude, honesty, humility and even that trait some guys don't understand - vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing open to life and living fearlessly are part of my new outlook. One example: I recently began bodyboarding (\"boogey boarding\"), and not long ago I had a magical experience - I was surrounded by dolphins as they fed, some as close as 10 feet away. One rose up out of the water to take a look at me. I was the closest human by quite a bit; everyone else was a couple of hundred feet away or more. That put a smile on my face and laughter in my heart for two full days. It felt like a personal gift from the universe. You can't experience life if you don't show up for it.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThere's a term I heard recently - ambivert. It describes someone who has the traits of both an extrovert and introvert. It seems to describe me, although I lean a little toward extroversion. I volunteer as a docent at a very popular local museum, so I get to be part tour guide, part educator and part entertainer. It's perfect for me, and I come away with a sense of joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a glass half-full kind of guy. Sure, sometimes the level drops a little below the halfway mark - I'm human - but more often the glass is almost overflowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not religious but I'm trying to find my way spiritually. (There's a story about how I came to finally acknowledge my spiritual side, something I kept suppressed for decades.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI've got a pretty sharp sense of humor (or at least I think so), but I know how to rein it in so I don't offend people. I don't take myself too seriously. Sometimes I wake up laughing. But I don't overplay my sense of humor - I'm presentable in public and I won't embarrass you.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't have any pets, I love 'em - cats, dogs, birds, just about anything that has even the slightest personality.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI'm a natural-born romantic (I love surprising the one I love with little tokens and acts) and I respect a woman's boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving someone special in my life is important to me, but not so important that I'd rush carelessly into it. Being in a romantic relationship isn't a one-way thing for me - I want to give at least as much as I get. After all, I'm not the center of the universe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFactoids\r\n\r\n\r\n* 64 years old as of the end of June of 2024\r\n* 5' 6\"\r\n* Low to mid 160s in weight\r\n* Retired (with a stable income)\r\n* No children (but I get along great with them)\r\n* Living solo\r\n* Mostly vegan at home and vegetarian with friends and eating in restaurants, although I recently began incorporating fish into my diet when out to eat\r\n* Non-smoker, light drinker, cannabis-friendly with the right people and in the right conditions (which amounts to maybe two or three times a year at most)\r\n* Navy veteran (but I don't wear it on my sleeve)\r\n* Liberal (surprising for a veteran, huh?)\r\n* Past careers:\r\n   * Photojournalist (also time as a columnist, editor and illustrator)\r\n   * IT professional\r\n* Lots of funny stories from a life of derring-do\u2026 and derring-don't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n* Aristotle\r\n(I don't even want to try to figure out what that quote means. It's Greek to me.)",

I\u2019m also open to more \u201ccasual\u201d possibilities, but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after you should probably ignore this doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was 11 years old, as my 12th birthday was approaching, I noticed that the people younger than me tended to have grand ambitions - going to space or becoming president or, in my case, building a new continent. But the people older than me generally did not have such ambitions. Clearly something happened to nearly everyone as they got older, such that they gave up on their dreams and decided to get married, buy a house and have 2.5 kids instead. I was terrified that would happen to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I swore very hard never to do that - never to embrace a life of mediocrity. And that basically worked.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want a cure for aging. I want weekend trips to the moon. I want flying cars and an indestructible body and tiny genetically-engineered dragons. I want to understand minds, be able to build them and edit them and read off their internals. I want things well beyond humanity\u2019s current bounds, and the focus of my life is pursuing those goals wherever they may lead.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I also want - very badly - is a partner for that pursuit. And I do mean a partner - not a hanger-on, not an enthusiastic supporter, but someone with grand ambitions of their own and capabilities on par with my own or perhaps even greater. I want someone who can actually be a peer in pushing beyond humanity\u2019s current abilities. Because that is what I need, in order to feel romantic love; nothing else seems to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2026 and that\u2019s it. There\u2019s lots of little things I could say - I am sadly quite straight, I love dancing, etc, etc\u2026 but I\u2019ve said the part which matters most and I don\u2019t want to water it down further. If a partnership of pushing beyond humanity\u2019s current abilities and making the world more to our tastes is something you want, you should get in touch and we can find out if we\u2019re a good fit along other axes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to scope me out, I write a lot on LessWrong. A message on LessWrong is the most expedient way to get in touch if we don\u2019t already have another channel; Facebook or the myriad of slack spaces also work if our social circles overlap already.",

They usually involve conversing on a wide variety of topics and sometimes playing board games.\r\n* I\u2019m a, mostly non-practicing, Buddhist.\r\n* I have an undergraduate degree in physics.\r\n* I\u2019m an anaclitic thinker and tend to over think things.\r\n* I enjoy conversations on philosophy, science, history, law, sociology, and many other topics.\r\n* I am open minded and tolerant of opinions on which I disagree.\r\n* I am teetotal.  I don\u2019t drink, smoke, or do recreational drugs.  I\u2019m okay with my partner drinking on occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho am I looking for?\r\n* I am looking for a 27-57 year old of any gender.\r\n* I would like to find a fellow nerd.\r\n* I am looking for a long term partner and potentially a life partner.\r\n* I value honesty, intelligence, independence, and humor in a romantic partner.\r\n* I would appreciate someone who could challenge me.\r\n* I have a preference for someone who is open minded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat am I looking for in a relationship?\r\n* I am looking for someone to spend time with and build a life with.\r\n* I am okay with not having children.  I am willing to consider raising children.  I do not want to be the biological father of children but would consider adoption, fostering, making use of a sperm bank, or helping to raise someone else\u2019s child.\r\n* I am willing to try new things.\r\n* I am looking for an intellectual and emotional connection.\r\n* I am happy with a more relaxed relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat type of relationship am I looking for?\r\n* I\u2019m happy with a monogamous relationship.  I\u2019m open to considering a non-monogamous relationship but I would be looking for a primary partner in such a setup.\r\n* I desire a relationship where we do things together but it is also okay if we do things apart.  This might be socializing without the other partner present or time for individual activities.\r\n* Sex is not important for me in a relationship but it is desired.  I am willing to partner with someone who wants to wait to have sex and potentially never wants to have sex.  My preference is to have a physical relationship once we get to know each other well enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I provide in a relationship?\r\n* I can provide emotional and social support to a partner.\r\n* I am told that I am a good listener.  I try to always ask if someone wants me to just listen or if they want feedback when they want me to listen.\r\n* I am someone who is not afraid to challenge his partner.\r\n* I can promise to be available to provide emotional, intellectual, physical, or logistical assistance in dealing with life\u2019s problems.\r\n* I am rather domestic.  I enjoy cooking and cleaning.  I do not enjoy yard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there any potential roadblocks?\r\n* I sometimes need some time for myself.\r\n* I am a leftist and a Buddhist.  I am okay with dating someone who has a different political and/or religious ideology than me but these might be important for other people.\r\n* I regularly attend mental health therapy.  My issues limit my ability to work and I apparently cannot work a full time job.  I have my mental health under control for the most part so I would not be needing much support here but my struggles are a part of who I am.\r\n* Some people might find me lacking in ambition.  I am not looking for a prestigious career, or to make lots of money, or to be in charge of things.\r\n* I find routines comfortable.  I have a weekly schedule where I have this for dinner this night, I go to the store this day, etc.  I can sometimes become attached to a comfortable routine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does one contact me and is there anything else?\r\n* I check my e-mail, schwabbenjamin@gmail.com, at-least once a day and usually multiple times a day.\r\n* I am not willing to relocate for a relationship that is just starting.  I am willing to relocate for a relationship that is well established and looks like it could last.\r\n* I live on my own in a two bedroom condo that I own outright.  I am willing to upgrade my living situation if a relationship advances far enough.  I prefer to live in a condo or townhome as opposed to a single family house.\r\n* I like animals though I currently don\u2019t have any pets.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHow\u2019s it going? I\u2019m Destiny!\r\n29 | female | 5\u20193\u201d | Naples, FL (For Now)\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\n\r\n\r\n* I am a big-hearted nerd looking for a match who is kind, funny, and loves stories.  \r\n* I am a published author of middle grade novels, audio dramas, and TTRPG content (writing is my main passion in case it\u2019s not obvious). I\u2019m also a lawyer, but I don\u2019t practice currently.  \r\n* I am on the asexual spectrum and looking for someone to form a connection with rather than jumping straight to physical intimacy. Taking it slow is important to me.  \r\n* I\u2019m a pescatarian (minus shellfish) but that\u2019s more a taste thing, not a moral stance. \r\n* I am currently in Naples, Florida but don\u2019t plan to be here indefinitely. Just waiting for the right opportunity to spur a move.\r\n* I am very open to starting out long distance. Some of my closest friendships started online. \r\n* Jump down to the bottom of the doc for pictures.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers\r\n* Kids: I\u2019m not interested in having kids, biological or adopted. \r\n* Age Range: I am looking for a guy who is in the 25-35 age range. \r\n* Conservative Politics: Although I\u2019m not overly political in my day to day life, my values don\u2019t align with conservative politics and it\u2019s important to me that whoever I date shares my values. \r\n* Hardcore Atheism: I was raised Christian and still consider myself Christian (though in a much less legalistic and much more acceptance and love thy neighbor kind of way). Though I don\u2019t need my partner to share my exact beliefs, I\u2019d prefer someone who is baseline spiritual, even if agnostic.\r\n* Smoking/Excessive Drinking: I don\u2019t smoke or drink. Casual drinking is fine but I don\u2019t like the smell of smoke.  \r\n* Polyamory: I am 100% monogamous. \r\n* Cats: I don\u2019t have anything against cats and in fact I like them a lot. I\u2019m just allergic to them unfortunately :( \r\nThings I Love \r\n* TTRPGs: I am never playing as many TTRPGs as I\u2019d like so, to supplement, I watch a bunch of actual plays. My current favorites are Dimension 20 (especially Fantasy High), Worlds Beyond Number, and NADDPOD. \r\n* Theme Parks: I grew up in Florida so I usually went to Orlando at least once a year and I\u2019ve kept the love of theme parks into adulthood. I love roller coasters (even though I can be a total baby about getting on them). The last one that really wowed me was Mako at SeaWorld. The airtime on the hills was amazing! \r\n* Escape Rooms: I am such a huge sucker for riddles and puzzles and there is not a secret tunnel in the world that I don\u2019t want to fling myself into with reckless abandon. It\u2019s the closest to a real-life point and click game that you can get and I love it. There\u2019s one in Baton Rouge called 13th Gate Escape that I\u2019ve been dying to check out. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s like the Disney of escape rooms! \r\n* Musical Theater: I lived in NYC for three years and the best part (besides the subway which I miss so much) was Broadway proximity. Some of my favorite shows are She Loves Me, Little Shop of Horrors, Six, Legally Blonde, Phantom, Ride the Cyclone, Matilda, Nerdy Prudes Must Die, and Hamilton. It hasn\u2019t been staged yet but I\u2019m also really enjoying Epic as it releases! And the single best musical episode of a TV show hands down is Once More With Feeling from Buffy (though Subspace Rhapsody in ST: Strange New Worlds is the best one in a long while).  \r\n* Travel: I love to travel but I don\u2019t love solo travel so I haven\u2019t gotten to do nearly as much as I\u2019d like. I\u2019ve been to the UK and Spain while studying abroad and Australia for my bar trip. I\u2019ve also been to Jamaica (where my parents are from) and several other Caribbean islands. I\u2019d really love to go back to Europe to hit some of the countries I missed and Japan is my current big ticket dream location. \r\nFive\u2026\r\n* Movies I Love: Enchanted, Shrek 2, Into the Spiderverse, Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, The Mummy\r\n* TV Shows I Love: Pushing Daisies, The Bear, Community, Frasier, Star Trek (TNG, VOY, DS9, LD, SNW)\r\n* Video Games I Love: Slay the Spire, Hades, Return to Monkey Island, Chicory, Tunic \r\n* Childhood Favorite Books: Ella Enchanted, Holes, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, The Lightning Thief, Dealing with Dragons\r\n* Non D&D TTRPGs I Love: Kids on Bikes/Brooms, Dread, Tales from the Loop, Perils & Princesses, Mausritter \r\nVibe Check Me\r\n* My Goodreads: I tend to read a lot of middle grade both because I like it and because I write it. \r\n* An Actual Play I Guest GM\u2019d: Watch me wrangle a group of princesses as they make (delightful) choices I never anticipated coming up when I wrote the module. \r\n* My itch.io Page: Check out some of my side projects. \r\nThink We Might Be a Good Match? \r\n* Feel free to shoot me an email at serendipitousfox37@gmail.com with some info about yourself and some pics.\r\n* If you don\u2019t think we\u2019d be a good match but you know someone who you think might, absolutely feel free to forward them this profile.\r\n* Also feel free to email me if you want to talk about Dimension 20. I always want to be talking about Dimension 20 :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPictures of Me\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n________________\r\n    ________________",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffJust a girl looking for someone to do the big shop with.\r\n \r\nI\u2019m Lou, a 36 year old from sleepy suburbia casually looking for the Tom to my Barbara.\r\n \r\nThis could be us\u2026\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n The basics:\r\n \r\n\u00b7          I\u2019m based on the Surrey/Hants/Berks border (near Guildford, Reading etc)\r\n\u00b7          Single, no kids\r\n\u00b7          Monogamous\r\n\u00b7          Social drinker, no smoking or drugs\r\n\u00b7          Liberal-leaning & atheist\r\n\u00b7          Dog owner (she\u2019s a massive flirt.  You\u2019ll like her.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nA little context:\r\n \r\nMy last serious relationship lasted 11 years, and I\u2019ve spent the past couple of years since then enjoying some solo time, focusing on personal growth and rediscovering old passions, with a few flings here and there but with dating generally taking a backseat.   \r\n   \r\nI\u2019m someone who has always been very independent and at this stage in my life I have the luxury of meeting all of my own material needs.  I\u2019m not looking for a man to put a ring on my finger, to give me children, or to bump one another up the property ladder. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for is much more elusive!  \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for a man I can call my home.  Someone to grow old with, to experience the euphoric highs of life with, and to soften the lows.  I\u2019m someone who experiences the world with a degree of childlike wonder and awe, and I\u2019m looking for someone with a similarly curious nature, who finds joy in the little things, has an optimistic and upbeat outlook, and an exceptional capacity for kindness, empathy and human connection.  We\u2019ll travel, share new experiences, surround ourselves with a network of dear mutual friends and build a peaceful, fulfilling life together. With a dog.  Or three. \r\n\r\n\r\nI consider myself an extroverted introvert, so whilst I\u2019m a good conversationalist I like to balance social events with plenty of quiet time and prefer small groups/1-1 to big parties.  I\u2019m equal-parts open book & intensely private, and I tend to be quite direct and unselfconscious, which has its pros and cons in dating.  I can be a bit of a pleasure-seeker and I believe it\u2019s perfectly ok to outsource things outside of your skillset to others if you have the means to do it (ahem, cough, shall we get a gardener, cough?)  \r\n \r\nA few things I love:\r\n \r\n\u00b7          Reading - I have a mountain of books piled up by my bed and I generally get through a couple a month.  I particularly enjoy fiction written by women about the female experience but I also love most novels set in the Middle East.  My favourite read of 2024 so far is \u201cHer Side of the Story\u201d by Alba de Cespedes, and my favourite book of all time is The Stray Cats of Homs by Eva Nour.  I\u2019m also a member of a non-fiction book club and we cover everything from neuroscience to mental health, travel, social causes and psychology.  I love the idea of reading a book in tandem with a partner so we can discuss it together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          Theatre \u2013 I genuinely believe it\u2019s the closest thing to real magic a person can experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          The water \u2013 My happy place is on or in the water.  Swimming, surfing, kayaking\u2026I can proudly say my Dryrobe gets used for its original purpose, and not just as an outdoor Oodie.  Once or twice a year I chuck the dog in the back of the car and drive to Devon or Cornwall for some vitamin sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          The arts \u2013 This Spring I managed to get my hands on the new Fujifilm X100 and I\u2019ve had a huge amount of fun recreating an analogue aesthetic and generally being a brat trying to snap candid photos of friends and family after they\u2019ve just taken a massive mouthful of cake.  I\u2019m interested in Brutalist and Bauhaus architecture, art, sculpture and contemporary poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          The outdoors \u2013 you won\u2019t find me dragging you up Snowdon every weekend, but I\u2019m definitely looking for a partner who shares my love of being outside.  I have a gorgeous sighthound, so long countryside walks are a big part of our day and a failsafe way to win her over.  More generally speaking, I love to eat al-fresco, cosy up in a pub garden under a blanket and discover new rambles on the AllTrails app. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          Good food \u2013 I want to know all the recommendations!  Where\u2019s your favourite place for fresh pastries?  Or that local Nepalese gem that no one else knows about?  I bought my first pasta maker this year and now tortellini is my entire personality.\r\n \r\nAbout you:\r\n \r\nLet\u2019s start with the non-negotiables.\r\n \r\n\u00b7          Aged 30-42\r\n\u00b7          Ideally based in the South East.  If in London, you should be happy to share time outside the city.\r\n\u00b7          Monogamous\r\n\u00b7          I don\u2019t intend to have children so it\u2019s important that you either don\u2019t want them, or are indifferent to them.  It\u2019s fine if you already have them, though!  I like kids, I just prefer not to have my own.\r\n\u00b7          No heavy-drinkers and no drug users\r\n\u00b7          Dog lover essential.  She\u2019s part of the family and will be joining us on many of our adventures. No cats\u2026sorry\u2026\r\n\u00b7          You take pride in your ability to maintain your home and can cook.\r\n \r\nThe rest\u2026\r\n \r\nI\u2019m a balanced person who tends to operate in lots of shades of grey.  I don\u2019t tend to be attracted towards extremes and I generally prefer a more measured personality.  \r\n \r\nI find myself leaning into people who are comfortable showing vulnerability.  Intelligent people with a calm aura, who enjoy thinking a question through before they answer it, and who are secure in their sense of self and what they have to offer the world.  My personal brand of humour is dry and silly as opposed to lots of \u201cbanter\u201d or loud jokes, but there\u2019s no accounting for chemistry, right?\r\n \r\nYou\u2019re passionate about your interests, quietly confident, an excellent conversationalist and sociable, but a little clumsy with it\u2026  If you\u2019ve ever said \u201clove you, bye!\u201d before hanging up on your boss and silently dying inside, I\u2019ll probably find that sexy. \r\n \r\n\u00b7          You\u2019re a successful professional (in any field) and financially secure.  I love a healthy-mix of wholesome low-key dates with the odd bougie restaurant and overpriced cocktail bar thrown in.  Ideally you\u2019ll be comfortable enough that you can join me for things like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          You\u2019re not a workaholic.  It seems to be a badge of honour these days to be building the next Fortune 500 company with eleventy-billion side-hustles on the go, but I\u2019m looking for someone who\u2019s generous with their time and attention.  Ambition and drive are hot, but not at the expense of your personal relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          You enjoy a mix of city & country.  I live semi-rurally and my weekends are full of trips to the farm shop, National Trust days, market towns and walks by the river followed by a coffee or glass of red.  My perfect date is a day at RHS Wisley to see the Autumn colours changing followed by dinner somewhere with a view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          You\u2019re present in the moment and value real-world experiences.  You\u2019re not addicted to social media or gaming. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          You like to stay healthy and fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          You\u2019re romantic and enjoy caring for others.  Thoughtful gestures, remembering things they said they liked and little acts of service come naturally to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          It matters to you that you\u2019re a good son, brother, uncle, friend, neighbour etc.  You value community and your personal relationships are important.  You\u2019re welcoming and inclusive of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          You\u2019re always kind and gracious in an argument.  You\u2019re open-minded, accepting of others\u2019 views, and happy to be challenged on your own.  You don\u2019t think you know it all, you can admit when you\u2019re wrong, and you\u2019re open to compromise.  You are tolerant of those whose political or social views may differ from yours and can engage in debate while keeping things light and playful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          You\u2019re a supportive partner who would view the two of us as our own little family unit, with or without children.  You\u2019re open to creating our own celebrations and traditions and are looking for someone to grow something exciting and meaningful with, making our own rules along the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00b7          You have an adventurous streak and enjoy trying new activities and generally broadening your horizons.\r\n \r\nThe prospect of meeting someone special is exhilarating but the whole online dating thing leaves me cold, so I figure why not inject a little old-school romance into the equation?  If you think we could be a good match (or you know someone who might!), take a tip from Tom Hanks and let me know why at datemelou@yahoo.com.  Better yet, send me suggestions for potential dates and fun things you think we\u2019d both enjoy, and don\u2019t forget to include a photo!",

With art always asking myself \u201cWhat are stories worth telling?\u201d.  Also connected with the broader Effective Altruism community. I have found plenty of wonderful friends there.\r\n\r\n\r\nI care about truth\u2122. Would love to eXplore how we think about the world through dialogue. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of learning + working it can happen that I sometimes spend days without leaving the house. But co-working with great people is also socializing, right? ^^\r\n\ud83d\udd0e What I am looking for\r\nYou?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neXploring more love. I think I have more to give.\r\nI want someone to cuddle and love.\r\nAnd to receive love and eXplore life together.\r\nCreate a shared protopia (prototype utopia).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my love languages is definitely touch. I enjoy giving (back-) massages. Learned how to do that professionally once and it has been a great life skill ever since. Friends can attest :p  \r\nJust great moments of mutual relaXation. Good stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n[some more ideas around deal-breakers and potential mutual interests at the end of this doc]\r\n\ud83d\udd7aShort Term\r\nBeing Hedon Buddies - yeah would be open to that\r\nAlways happy to go on a fun date with someone even if \u2018nothing more\u2019 emerges from that\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoly:\r\nWhen I created this doc in early 2023 I wrote \u201c\"Polysecure\" is on my (long) reading list. Would bring it to the top of my reading list for the right person :D\u201d\r\nWell that is funny! I guess I did find the right person and did end up reading that book (and many others). I have been in a poly-relationship lasting since Summer 2023. So going over a year and going well. \ud83d\ude42 Feels very much new to me though.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy partner and I with 2 amazing friends\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked my current partner to leave a note here. This is what they had to say on the fly:\r\n \u201c10/10 would date again\u201d (they have edit access to this doc if they ever wanna change it :D)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1e Long Term  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHmm eXpectation setting: There is space in my life currently for up to 6 dates a month I guess. Like if I actually look at my calendar and my plans.\r\nIn the long term I would like to introduce you to my partner. I want us to be chill around each other. To be fair this would be the first time dating 2 people at the same time. So I would just be open to eXploring and communicating what works for us. So I don\u2019t have clearly detailed plans for this yet. \r\n\r\n\r\nBelow you can read what my romantic single self had to say in early 2023:\r\n\r\n\r\nI want us to encourage each other to become better. Grow together[a]. Which could also just mean that most of the time we are both each other's comforting recharging resting place.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am deeply inspired by this impressive elderly couple who wrote a free book[b][c] after ~50 years of marriage. They both work in nuclear proliferation and had to first 'create peace within their relationship before bringing it to the rest of the world'. Our relationship might not look at all like theirs and we don't have to work on the same problems but I would want both of us to contribute to the world in some way or another while our relationship will contain a great amount of laughter and kindness - so we can be a shining star for others \ud83c\udf1f\r\n\r\n\r\nKids: I don\u2019t feel like getting kids right now. On the other hand I would not be surprised that with the right person I could imagine starting a family in the neXt 3 - 10 years.\r\nBut I could also see that I can scratch that itch by becoming a teacher of some sorts (e.g. professor, mentor or being the funny uncle^^). I am currently not feeling like I am missing something and I can see myself never having kids and still living a flourishing happy fulfilled meaningful life. But I (naively) think having kids can be a beautiful thing.\r\nThis would be something I would love to think through and eXplore together after a while. Let's see what feels right.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be honest I am eXcited about the neXt relationship (hence this doc). Each year I learn more about myself and forms of communications (and have become a better friend of mine as a result \ud83d\ude0a). I can see how that knowledge would just help greatly in a relationship.  (Things I read about and/or where I participated in workshops: Non-Violent Communication, Double CruX, Street Epistemology, intrinsic values, CBT, mindfulness, ask vs guess vs tell culture, consent games, \u2026)\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nI am living in Lichtenberg-Berlin. If you are in Berlin or around that would be cool!\r\nBut everything in Germany that is reachable via train could be nice.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I am in and around London at least once a year.\r\nCould see myself making 1 week long trips in Europe for the right person given that I work remotely.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am kinda eXcited about the idea of having lovely connections in different parts of the world. Places to come home to in a way. But I can definitely see how this might be in conflict for you/me to be the building block of a committed relationship. \r\n\ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\udc91 Date Ideas\r\n\u201cFor picnic and picnic related dates, press 1\r\nFor creative and drawing activities related dates, press 2\r\nFor \u2026.\u201d\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nLeft: bike that seats 2 for shared picnic trip\ud83e\udd68\u2615, \r\ncenter: #cruisin\ud83d\udef9, \r\nright: fun with body paint, probably better for third, fourth or n-th date \ud83d\ude05\r\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c What am I doing with my life\r\nAm a researcher and team coordinator at a not-for-profit research org where I look into fun-stuff such as nuclear winters (but mostly support my brilliant colleagues). Currently, I have reduced my hours to eXplore more creative ways of adding value to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nI build art eXhibitions that deal with the future. Watch Facing Moloch on YouTube if you like! \r\nI also enjoy imagining what if we get it right. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am concerned about Global Catastrophic Risks and Existential Risks and devote a significant part of my work/life/art to contribute to these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I also wanna have fun in the meantime. Live fully / intentionally.\r\n\ud83d\udcdc Credentials\r\n\u201cYou are the most optimistic doomy person I have met!\u201d - random conference attendee in Prague\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cwarm & kind person, great friend\r\nreconciles being scientifically minded and being deeply artistic \r\nforward and systematic thinker who cares about flourishing of humanity \r\nCreative about grasping Zeitgeist and Ideengeschichte in art \u201c - close friend\r\n\u2753Potential deal breakers[d]\r\non leaving the house/city for nature\r\nI guess I don\u2019t go much into nature out of intrinsic motivation.\r\nI love going to lakes for swimming.\r\nAm happy to take a run through a park or go on a bike tour in the forestry greeny lake-rich outskirts of Berlin. But I only occasionally seek these kinds of activities on my own.\r\nI wonder if I have that impression right now just because the last few months I have been recovering from a sports-injury .\r\n\r\n\r\n(I have got passions for lifetimes to pursue just with internet access at home \ud83d\ude05)\r\nSo if you are seeking someone to retreat into the woods you have some convincing to do. But maybe you are the dryad to lure me into the forest ^^\r\n\r\n\r\nTraveling\r\nI don\u2019t fly around as much (as some of my friends). I have some sort of deeper ingrained belief around responsible spending and carbon footprint and a cluster of 'something feels off'.\r\nBut I do make eXceptions for projects / work which I deem valuable. As a result I get to visit Europe's capital cities for conferences. In 2022 I was in Paris, Prague, and London (+ a couple of German cities). In 2023 I added Warsaw and Vienna to the list. Usually adding a few days around events/conferences to eXplore the city and visit museums or meet-up with people I normally only interact with online.\r\nGenerally, I prefer vacations which are reachable via train.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet\r\nI am vegan around 98% of the time. 2% vegetarian are from eating at restaurants and families where there are no convenient vegan options. I would prefer for you to be vegetarian or vegan.\r\nAlso, potatoes are the best! Here have one and rejoice \ud83e\udd54\r\n\r\n\r\nDrugs\r\nCaffeine in the form of coffee mostly. Occasionally, but increasingly rarer, a beer. You do you \ud83d\ude42  But taking drugs together is not a date idea I am interested in.\r\n\u2795Bonus\r\nYou like nerding out about music (I like prog-metal music among many other genres)\r\nI love discovering new music\r\nI also enjoy sharing music, so if you are open to new stuff that would be cool. \r\nWould love to hear why you enjoy a certain style / artist / song. \r\n\r\n\r\nI find it inspiring when people are eXpressing themselves and are turning an emotion into art. Dancers, musicians, painters, poets. If we are getting together, chances are high that I will draw you (like one of the french girls). \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\n\r\nI admire it when people can think clearly, decouple concepts, eXplore ideas, and communicate well. Scientists, coders/programmers, writers. Let's update our models of what is actually going on. Does your map fit the territory? \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to get to know me - Awesome! Feel free to ping me:\r\nSignal: aeXplorer.12000\r\nTelegram: @globalcatstrophicrisk\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to let me know if you missed something from this doc or think it could be improved somehow \ud83d\ude42\r\nHere is my Admonymous link for anonymous feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading all of this!

I barely use Instagram.)\r\nBasic info:\r\nDating status: Single (divorced in 2016), seeking dates and long-term relationship, open to short-term\r\nLocation: Orlando\r\nAge: 32 (born in 1992)\r\nKids: Shared custody of my 10-year-old daughter; not interested in more children of my own\r\nCore values: Honesty, openness, charity/love, organization\r\nPolitics: Liberal\r\nLifestyle: Physically active. I drink socially. I don\u2019t smoke or do drugs.\r\nReligion: None\r\nOccupation: Data Analyst\r\nEducation: B.S. Statistics\r\nInterests: \r\nArt (consuming): Broadway musicals, girlpop, open mics, reading, botanical gardens\r\nArt (creation): Cooking, game design, piano\r\nPhysical: Biking, walking, hiking, pickleball, volunteering\r\nIntellectual: Logic puzzles, Programming (Python), board games (especially chess and Scrabble)\r\nTravel/adventure: NYC, skydiving, national parks, Cedar Point, New Orleans, Seattle\r\nMisc: Fancy restaurants (love mocktails), people-watching (coffee shops, libraries, parks), tutoring\r\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/JakeStiles\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for:\r\nI\u2019m seeking someone to care for and who cares for me. I\u2019ve been single since about July 2023, and I\u2019m increasingly tired of it. I am a positive and happy guy, and I feel overfull with capacity for love and close relationships, but I currently lack an outlet. When I\u2019m with my daughter, I\u2019m able to care for her, and our relationship is great. But our inconsistent schedule together (1-4 days a week with variable hours on those days) leaves a lot of alone time. I cope by surrounding myself with strangers/acquaintances (at coffee shops, libraries, parks, social clubs/meetups, and bars) and friends, but I still feel lonely.\r\nWho I\u2019m looking for:\r\nMore important to me\r\nAge: Prefer within -8 years or +5 years of my age.\r\nPolitics: Prefer liberal (If you\u2019d seriously consider voting for Trump, we likely won\u2019t get along well enough to date).\r\nChildren: Prefer none, but could consider being a step-parent especially if your situation is similar to mine (one older child, shared custody, and not full-time care). If you have two or more young children full-time, we likely wouldn\u2019t make a great match.\r\nLifestyle: Prefer active, non-smoker, and not a heavy drinker.\r\nLocation: Prefer in/near Orlando. I won\u2019t move from Orlando due to my daughter. \r\nLess important to me\r\nReligion: Prefer areligious, however as long as you don\u2019t seek to impose your religion on others, I\u2019m not fussed.\r\nOccupation/Education: Prefer employed and intelligent. If you plan to be fully financially dependent on your partner, then I suggest you look for someone with a higher income than me.\r\nMonogamy/non-monogamy: Open to monogamy, polyamory, ENM, relationship anarchy, etc. I\u2019ve had differing thoughts and preferences on this over time, and I\u2019m happy so long as there is honesty and an open dialogue about what we want.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m like:\r\nEnthusiastic:\r\n* I respond to texts right away.\r\n* I respect mutual enthusiasm: if you\u2019re into something, I\u2019m into it. If you\u2019re meh, I\u2019m out. \r\n* I like to express and receive love through quality time, words of affirmation, touch, and acts of service. Giving/receiving gifts doesn\u2019t come as naturally to me.\r\n* I like to joke, tease, and generally not take things seriously (unless they\u2019re serious things).\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughtful and honest: \r\n* I think before I speak.\r\n* I'm polite and non-pushy.\r\n* I admit when I\u2019m wrong and appreciate when others do the same.\r\n* I\u2019m positive and don\u2019t focus on things I dislike.\r\n* I argue calmly and quietly and love to have friendly debates about trivial things.\r\n\r\n\r\nObsessive:\r\n* I keep my house clutter-free and love to simplify (aka throw things away).\r\n* I love to organize my life, especially using Google Sheets and Google Docs (as I\u2019m sure you can tell).\r\n* I plan things in advance and arrive early almost everywhere that I go.\r\n* I like to \u201cgo deep\u201d on things. My favorite games are Hanabi and Slay the Spire, each of which I\u2019ve put hundreds of hours into.\r\n* In relationships, I want to spend lots of time together.\r\n* I\u2019ve been learning piano very slowly by self-teaching myself one song (and no others) for months.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharitable:\r\n* I like doing good deeds such as volunteering, picking up trash, listening patiently to someone who needs a friend, giving rides to/from the airport, helping people move.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccessful and happy:\r\n* Besides being single (which I greatly dislike and causes me some mental distress), I have my life together. I\u2019m a great father to my daughter, my finances are reasonably in order, I\u2019m relatively healthy and active, and I excel at my job. \r\nConclusion:\r\nI trust this has provided more than enough information for you to decide if you\u2019d like to go on a date. My contact info is at the start of this doc. Thanks for your time, and I look forward to meeting and learning about you!",

I took the bait and watched a few of his videos of India. I am from India so I am interested in people\u2019s experience of India.\u00a0However, I am not interested in seeing the filthy parts of India, I skip over those for some reason. I don\u2019t know why!\nAnyway, the videos are great and the guy seems authentic. YouTube realized I like such stuff so it sent another video called Travel the world, ask strangers the wildest questions, it will change your life....\nDecember 30, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a04 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0663 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\nIstanbul\nDay 0 I couldn\u2019t sleep at night, thanks jet lag! So, I decided to go get something to eat at 3 am and my neighborhood bakery was open. It\u2019s 24*7 and highly rated. The bakery is tiny with lots of outdoor seating on both sides of the street. It was 3 am and it felt like 8 pm. The street was bustling with people, chai, cigarettes and chatter. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes....\nOctober 31, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a010 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a02071 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\nMaine\nIt\u2019s 7 am and we\u2019re driving towards the national park to see the Cadillac mountain. It\u2019s the final spot on the itinerary. A friend invited me to this trip. We\u2019re four guys, two of them I met the first time at the rental car center. It\u2019s a short weekend trip with people with very different personalities.\nI have done such trips before but this one has been somewhat different. I see conversations that I would call aggressive to be commonplace....\nOctober 25, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a03 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0484 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\n30 Day Challenge: Fruit till noon\nBaby pineapple, Peru\nI read Living with a Seal last year and in the book, Jesse Itzler talks about only eating fruit till noon. It sounds like a healthy change in lifestyle. My usual breakfast is eggs if there\u2019s a breakfast at all, which I think is healthy but I am gonna challenge myself to follow Jesse\u2019s advice and see if it makes a difference.\nSince, I have already eaten breakfast today, I am gonna start the clock tomorrow....\nOctober 11, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a01 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0124 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\nSan Francisco\nThis is my 6th time (or maybe it\u2019s 7th, I am not certain) in San Francisco and everytime I come here, I have had feelings in the realm of:\noh, this city could be a paradise but sadly it\u2019s so far away from it. It\u2019s pretty meh! It\u2019s terrible, why would anyone live here? I really wanna like this place but it\u2019s still terrible. I have wished and tried hard to like this place and I feel so happy that it\u2019s paid off....\nOctober 4, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a02 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0265 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\nIn the moment\nI was listening to a podcast that mentioned that Gen Z regularly binges old high school videos from the 80s and 90s on YouTube. The implication was that we really miss the old times of living in the moment. The time when you could talk to people anywhere, when nobody was on their phones all the time, when nobody was wearing airpods. To be honest, I am an old soul and I miss those times....\nSeptember 29, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a02 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0356 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\nDecisions\nI haven\u2019t had a problem making decisions until now. I had always been at ease with them because I had a strong compass. The compass always pointed to career and financial success. I evaluated all my choices on the objective questions\nIs it good for my career? Will it help me move up the ladder? Will it help me financially? Focussing on just one dimension is a bad way to make decisions....\nSeptember 21, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a03 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0532 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\nThe Harsh Realities of Legal Immigration\nThe essay was published on Tangle.\nRegardless of their politics, everyone has a view on immigration. More often than not, people support legal immigration over illegal immigration. Both sides also generally agree that highly skilled immigrants are a valuable asset to the U.S. economy. I would even say most people who immigrate illegally would want to do so legally. But obscure and dated laws in the U.S. make legal immigration downright painful....\nSeptember 12, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a09 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a01710 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\nPeru\nI am at the Lima airport waiting for my flight back to NYC. It\u2019s been a fabulous 11 days in Peru. I don\u2019t think I got to see a whole lot of places but I did have a fantastic time and I made a bunch of friends. It\u2019s amazing and unexpected how great this trip has been.\nIt seems weird when I say I spent 11 days but didn\u2019t see much....\nSeptember 11, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a08 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a01568 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\nCities\nCities shape us in profound ways, often more than we realize. I am sure you have heard of the quote that you\u2019re the average of 5 people around you. I can\u2019t say how true that is but I can say that the basic idea makes sense. We are influenced by our surroundings, both consciously and unconsciously.\nCities, however, are more than just collections of people. Each city has its own culture and an implicit message, and whether we like it or not we\u2019re influenced by it to a degree....\nAugust 25, 2024\n\u00b7\u00a05 min\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0943 words\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0Me\nNext\u00a0\u00a0\u00bb\n\u00a9 2024\nYash Sharma\nPowered by\nHugo\n&\nPaperMod",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHi.  Thanks for reading my info.  My name is Brian.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a 57-year old white male living in the Phoenix area.  I have a background in IT and a graduate degree. I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d and about 210. I seek femme or androgynous-presenting people of any gender and prefer smart, engaged and self-aware types. I look for a connection & serious chemistry with someone before I can really get into a relationship.  It\u2019s that tangible vibe that I can\u2019t ignore and can\u2019t make up.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am nonbinary and genderfluid; some might say \u2018genderchaotic\u2019.  This does not mean I cross dress.  I am just not interested in being a masculine male in attitude or look and it\u2019s much easier to just go with what looks and feels good to me and often it\u2019s black.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm an INFJ-T so fairly loner-ish, a Sigma and 6w5 Enneatype.  I like my own company when I am not partnered but tend to focus on the person I'm with when that applies.  I prefer small groups where I can talk to interesting people and don't particularly care for big, noisy venues.  I'm extremely well-read and look for the same in a relationship - show me your library. One of the main aspects of my personality is an obsession with the esoteric, the metaphysical, the unusual and hidden.  This extends to physical and emotional intimacy.  I want a deep, visceral reaction when I look at my partner and vice versa.  We should know what the other is thinking across a crowded room with just a look and feel a need to be touching and affectionate no matter the circumstances.  QAF. Curiosity, exploration, openness, desire and heat - if you resonate with \u201cTake Me to Church\u201d by Hozier, that captures the feeling I have in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I'm not reading or pursuing these things I'm listening to podcasts, sometimes working on novels or nonfiction research projects or watching documentaries. I play videogames and spend time in Second Life.  I have done some virtual photography and found it very soothing and creative.  I like to hand-bind journals when I have time.  I enjoy target shooting but am not a hunter.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a smart woman of any gender, 40 and up, who knows herself but wants to dig deeper.  I like those who are mentally strong, who have survived some of the rough experiences life can provide and come back stronger.  I tend to be attracted to tomboys and transwomen who look good in jeans and a tank top and I'm wild for ink and piercings. I like curves, whether they are natural thickness or muscles.  If you speak multiple languages or ASL I'd love to learn, ditto with anything else you're good at and obsessed with. I seek someone similar who is focused on their spiritual development and the search for knowledge and understanding. I want to find someone who is in touch with all aspects of themselves and not put off by the shadow.  Physically I am often drawn to women with a high melanin content but I'm open to anyone with whom I connect.  I'm not a monotheist and I lean way left politically. I would do best with someone of like persuasion who is open-minded, tolerant, progressive and spiritually attuned.  Bonus points if you are into Star Wars, particularly those who run around with red lightsabers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd really like to meet someone in the Phoenix area but I'm open to travel and potential relocation if the vibe is right.  I'd consider anything more or less in the Western US.  I'm a monogamous person though I would consider a closed throuple with the right pair.  I want to meet someone who first and foremost gets me just as I am, accepts me where I'm at and respects my wants and needs as I will surely do the same in return.  I'm housebroken, responsible, employed and live on my own.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this resonates with you, send me your bat sign\u2026  bhodges209@gmail.com.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDaryna\u2019s Date Me Doc\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBackground\r\nUkrainian, living in Germany since 2015. I moved here for studies (rationally) and due to my late childhood memories of calm, clean cities and sporty, smiling people (emotionally). I've also lived in China and the States, so I\u2019m fairly used to fitting my life into two (largely overweight) suitcases. I was supposed to move to Stuttgart but stayed in Berlin (mainly because my paintings no longer fit into those two suitcases).\r\nLanguages: German, English, Russian. Any of them goes, but I feel less witty in German.\r\nLocation: Berlin, DE. I previously couldn\u2019t imagine myself moving elsewhere, but now that has changed, and I would switch cities for new experiences and to shake things up.\r\nHow I see myself: Emotional, curious, creative, extremely stubborn.\r\nHow my close friends/family see me: \u2018She is kind, ambitious, self-reflective, and gives good advice. But beware of the girl, she\u2019s an avid hoarder\u2019 (the \u2018avid hoarder\u2019 part was probably about the amount of art supplies I own, haha).\r\nWho I am not: Never say never, but I\u2019m not a party/club person. I feel comfortable around big numbers people at conferences and events at work but prefer smaller groups and dialogues in my private life. The quality of conversation matters to me. And the clubs nowadays don\u2019t even play Britney Spears songs, so why would you want to go anyway, right?\r\nLW/EA community: This is how I came across the concept of a date-me-doc but wouldn\u2019t expect any other approach from the rationalists. My approach towards charity and rationalism grew naturally till I found out that it is in tune with a large community out there. I would like to engage with it more on a regular basis since I agree that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\r\nRandom facts: I was part of a girls' band in high school. I put salt on top of sweet foods (ice cream, chocolate, porridge, etc.). My guinea pig was a centenarian (by animal measures, 8 years = 144 years) and had a collection of hand-made dresses, made out of socks and rhinestones  \ud83c\udf80 \r\n\r\n\r\nMy everyday life\r\nWork: I identify a lot through what I do, so my profession is worth a mention. I am an architect and an interior designer who is currently transitioning into the field of tattooing. I've been painting since I was little and previously used to sell my art. I paint with oils and digitally, also experimenting a lot with charcoal and ink.\r\nBooks: I usually read up to 5 books simultaneously, mostly sci-fi, dystopias, biographies, and non-fiction on society, economics, and psychology. I also love myths and fairytales of various nations. Currently, I'm relaxing my reading muscle and enjoying a fantasy book series from my childhood about a boy who was given ancient powers to rule Hell and his controversial journey to find Heaven.\r\nMusic: I really enjoy silence, to be honest. I am not much of a \u2018music playing in the background all day long\u2019 kind of person unless it's something repetitive like lo-fi. When I sit and listen to music, it\u2019s usually some indie rock, hip-hop, classical, or jazz music. I am very unspoiled as far as the quality of the equipment, like sound systems or record players, goes, so feel free to teach me a thing or two about it.\r\nSports: Mostly yoga, pilates, and gym. I\u2019ve had a quite bad knee injury and have been taking it slow since then. I would love to try more group sports and hiking in the future.\r\nActivities: Painting/sketching, photographing, singing. Redesigning my apartment for the 100th time, helping friends redesign their apartments for the 100th time, treasure hunting for new lampshades at thrift stores. Repotting my astonishingly fast-growing basil plants.\r\nWhere you can usually find me: Bookstores, vintage markets, parks, theaters, cinemas, somewhere in the streets (I walk a lot), or at home enjoying my afternoon beauty sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nDating preferences\r\nLove language: All of them matter, but I would pick Physical Touch and Acts of Service as my main ones. With Physical Touch being one of the things you can almost exclusively get in a romantic relationship, it is a very important feature for me. While Acts of Service show the invisible care, and I like their casual subtlety.\r\nStyle: Monogamous, long-term. Committed, honest, intimate, caring, romantic.\r\nLooking for: A kind, reliable, emotionally mature, ambitious person with a strong set of values they stand by.\r\nKids: For me, the partner comes first, and children are negotiable. I am looking for a person with whom I could share this experience, but having kids is not the main goal of a relationship. I want someone I know I can safely rely on while bearing and raising a child, sharing this responsibility together.\r\nSidenotes: I don\u2019t drink/smoke/take drugs, so would prefer a partner with no habitual substance abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou made it to the end of this document! Feel free to contact me @silxxdar on Telegram or share this doc with anyone who you think would be a great match for me, thank you.",

Has a (world\u2019s best) cat. Happy for you to already have children\r\n* Diet: usually vegetarian, often vegan, occasionally pescatarian, hardly ever omnivore. Never smokes, rarely drinks alcohol\r\n* Has some chronic illnesses which are normally under control, but prone to fatigue\r\n* Autistic and introverted (INTJ), but I have good communication skills\r\n* Looking for: man/woman, for a long term relationship, ideally a life long partnership (happy to start from LDR), and/or friends\r\n* Relationship type: I think monogamish, but open relationship negotiable (I\u2019ve had both mono and poly relationships. I\u2019m not really jealous in general)\r\n* Location: Happy to relocate to anywhere if the climate is not extreme\r\n* If you want to see my OKC profile, here it is\r\n\ud83c\udf38More about me:\r\n* I\u2019m a rationalist/EA adjacent. I seem to get along best with people in this community\r\n* I like learning things (when my brain fog permits) and my topics of interests are:\r\n   * Philosophy\r\n   * Psychology\r\n   * Behavioural economics\r\n   * Health/medicine/epigenetics\r\n   * Eugenics/Ethics\r\n   * History\r\n   * AI safety\r\n* But I\u2019d enjoy people explaining things they\u2019re passionate about to me, pretty much anything. I find it very attractive when someone\u2019s very nerdy about things\r\n* I work really hard to improve myself, my health, and my life, taking one day at a time\r\n* I meditate regularly, and am trying to learn more about Buddhist philosophy and Stoicism. I don\u2019t practise any religion\r\n* I go for walks daily, but my favourite kind of walks are nature walks, as well as culture walks in a foreign city on occasions. I also exercise regularly\r\n* I have overcome so many life challenges including dropping out of high school because of my health, severe depression for decades (no longer the case, yay!), illegal dismissal from employers, coming to London from Japan all by myself, changing careers from a pastry chef to a software engineer, accepting long term illnesses etc\r\n* I\u2019m extremely agentic and get things done. Super responsible. Good at taking initiatives. Used to be type A, worked really hard to not be.\r\n* I'm very independent and I can take care of myself, and love being on my own (and my beloved cat Toffin), but also love spending time with my partner\r\n* I'm at my happiest when I'm around nature, and animals, reading/watching a film quietly, enjoying tasty food, wandering around a museum, or exploring a foreign place\r\n* I'm very good at cooking and baking, as well as cleaning. It would be nice to cook together with my partner\r\n* I have a good sense of humour, and am childlike\r\n* I'm smart and would like my partner to be way (ideally one more big 'WAY') smarter than me and teach me anything\r\n* Very cliche but I like watching films, listening to music, reading books\u2026trying to get back into more creative hobbies like writing, drawing, singing, playing the ukulele, craft etc\r\n* I used to love cycling, swimming, and dance aerobics, and I\u2019m working to be able to do those again!\r\n* I\u2019m the kind of person who NEVER FAILS to pet a cat on the street, or always tries to rescue snails when they\u2019re on the street\r\n* I love enjoying nice food (just tasty, doesn\u2019t have to be fancy. In fact, my favourite kind of food is free food) and it\u2019s very important to me that I can share that enjoyment with my partner\r\n* As you can see, I\u2019m very autistic honest and transparent\r\n* I'm reasonable and able to change my views based on evidence. I apologise for my actions if I made any mistake. I might argue to understand and reach an agreement if there's a relationship problem, but I don't fight.\r\n* *Recently moved from Camden (central London) to Milton Keynes (30 min train from London Euston) where there\u2019s more green and is quieter. I live alone in a house full of plants with Toffin, and there are a bunch of cows 10 minutes walk away which I\u2019m making friends with :)\r\n* I\u2019d seriously consider being a housewife if you\u2019d like that too. I\u2019m just really good at house chores and I find it way too demanding to continue working full time with my health conditions\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf33What I\u2019m looking for:\r\n* Companionship based on trust and deep friendship where we help each other grow and be a better version of ourselves, and be happy together. We respect each other's space and also enjoy each other's company. We feel truly safe and free to be ourselves.\r\n* Although I loved living in a big city where a community of friends are walking distance away, and I also want to travel around the world, at this point in life (how many years have we got before the AGI?), I want to live in the countryside with a big, beautiful garden with a bunch of animals. I would like a partner who would want to share that quiet, peaceful life mindfully, enjoying each other\u2019s company and tiny little things nature would grant us each day\r\n* I don\u2019t particularly see sex as an important factor in a relationship (although I do love physical touch). I just think there are other things more fun to do together than sex? If you think regular, frequent sex is essential in a relationship, I might not be your girl. Happy for you to change my mind about it though - it might be different in a truly loving relationship which sadly I\u2019ve never had\r\n* Someone who understands my health limitation and is willing to support me when I need (it\u2019s often more emotional support rather than a practical one although my mental health is well under control thanks to years of effort and resources gained)\r\n* From my experience (I\u2019m recently out of an 8 year relationship) someone with below characteristics will probably work well with me:\r\n   * Very patient\r\n   * Very stable (not much emotional fluctuations towards negative direction in particular)\r\n   * Who is capable of loving someone deeply\r\n   * Very smart and knowledgeable\r\n   * Kind and caring\r\n   * Practices mindfulness/meditation and has basic understanding of psychology and philosophy in general, as well as communication (NVC, IFS etc)\r\n   * Has a great sense of humour\r\n   * Still avoids covid, or is willing to avoid it for me (I certainly don\u2019t need Long Covid on top of what I already have)\r\n   * Willing to communicate and be honest and transparent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading!

Right now, I'm prioritizing reskilling, making meaningful creative work of my own, and getting connected to people who share my values. There have been so many great conversations since arrival, and feel so grateful to be here.   \r\n\r\n\r\nI am just as much looking for friends.  Feel free to reach out if there's stuff you resonate with on here, regardless of whether or not you'd want to date.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcdc No LLMs were used in the making of this doc. \ud83d\udcdc\r\n\t\r\n\r\nMind\r\n  \r\n\r\nMisc. Mental Info\r\nJust some tidbits that might be relevant to anyone assessing my fit as a partner.  \r\n\r\n\r\n* I\u2019ve generally preferred thinking about things over people.  It just feels easier and more fun/satisfying. But I\u2019ve been reading more about the latter lately to compensate for this, and have leveled up on people-attunement this past year especially, and have enjoyed the journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I have a maximalism bias.  When presented with two options, I try to find a way to make both work simultaneously by default. Complexity can be beautiful in and of itself.  More is more!\r\n   * This is not always a good thing, but it has served me well enough to be labeled as neutral. \r\n   * I do respect minimalism too, and wouldn\u2019t mind it in a partner.  \r\n\r\n   * Secure attachment style.  I thank my parents every day for this one. \r\n\r\n\r\n   * Highly dopaminergic compared to H&N.  I\u2019m creatively ambitious and enjoy thinking about/planning for the future, sometimes to the expense of living in the present.  But I think I\u2019m OK with that tradeoff.  \r\n\r\n\r\n   * Neurodivergent to some extent. I have not sought a formal diagnosis because I wouldn\u2019t do anything different with the info.  I\u2019m comfortable with how my mind works, and trust it to steer me in leading a good life and achieve my goals.  \r\n   * I get along well with neurotypical folks, but if your divergence is of an overlapping frequency to mine, then we have the potential to be super-compatible.\r\n\r\n\r\n   * \u201cAmbivert\u201d is probably the best way to describe my social type. When I\u2019ve had a lot of one thing, I tend to want more of the other.  The amount of drain/recharge I get from social situations is also highly dependent on the individuals involved and other stimuli.  Speaking to people with shared lexicons, values, and interests tends to recharge me rather than burn me out.  But I do want to avoid following the path of least resistance into echo chambers, too.  SF is full of these. \r\n\r\n   * I was raised with a fixed mindset and zero sum thinking, but have consciously shifted out of them.  Sometimes remnants still show up, though.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ This old art experiment was made by vectorizing regular slices of an MRI scan at each dimension and extruding them in 3D software.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreative Identity\r\nI'm an artist/designer who loves losing myself in my work, and often think in hypotheticals and alternate worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\nA specific design language threads through all the mediums I work in.  It's an honest expression of who I am, revealed through the lens of what I find beautiful.  In a sense, we ARE our lenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nArt is a beacon, something one casts up to say \u201cif you resonate with this somehow, we have a much greater than average chance of being friends.\u201d Or, at the very least, have a great conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay is an important part of the process, and I hope that comes out in my work.  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ Cosplaying as myself in front a 14-ft vinyl print of one of my artworks, installed at a festival in Southern CA\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAfter contracting for companies for over a decade, I\u2019ve more seriously set my sights on making my own interactive experiences.  I'm slowly building an indie game (3 really, haha) and have dipped my toe into software when I need a tool that doesn\u2019t exist.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI say \u201cslowly\u201d because, as of recently, I\u2019ve shifted focus away from growing my studio and back to learning some technical skills I\u2019ve wanted to have for a long time.  It\u2019s an investment in manifesting my creative vision at much larger scales and with much more control, but at the cost of time and a steep/long learning curve. Time will tell if that gamble pays off.  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ I recently had 3 works at a museum in Southern California, but I\u2019m more in the entertainment industry than fine art. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMind\u2019s Eye\r\nI\u2019m a pretty visual thinker.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have ideasthesia in addition to synesthesia, and perceive forms, spaces, and colors as drivers (or by-products?) of thought. \r\n\r\n\r\nDescribing the different \u201cmodes\u201d is always fun, and I look forward to getting into it if you\u2019re curious.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m toying with the idea of making a video game about exploring someone\u2019s mindscape.\r\nIt\u2019s even a medium of expression in my sci fi world.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n^ An attempt to depict the form language for numberscapes. \r\n(Ask me about numberscapes.)\r\n\r\n\r\n< I have a lot of little doodles like this, stepping stones for ideas.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tAesthetics & Inspiration\r\nEverything is aesthetic in some form, even the non-physical.  I\u2019m deeply attuned to this frequency of being and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeauty hits me very powerfully.  When I connect with something beautiful to me, I lose all sense of self for about a second.  These moments are fleeting, but spiritual in their pure transcendence.  I\u2019m constantly scanning the world for beauty, and can find it frequently in small mundane details: chips of paint, lichen, the form of gravel\u2026 or just great space relationships, like the shape of the negative space between two overlapping buildings.  \r\n\r\nIf we\u2019re out walking, expect delays as I take pictures of stuff.\r\n\tNature\r\nThe natural world is a huge source of inspiration, especially the microworld.  I like to look at life through a scale-free lens, generally imagining that small things are big, but sometimes the other way around.  It\u2019s a rich source of novel inspiration.\r\nI have a pretty bangin\u2019 mineral collection, and a digital microscope to help explore them!  I love imagining what it would be like to climb around on them if I were tiny. \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ Lab-grown magnesium crystal, China - minerals that look plant-like are kind of the best thing ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ Iridescent limonite/geothite, China - it\u2019s super delicate.  It\u2019s essentially just iron!\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n^ Pagoda Calcite, China.  This one has a sublime distribution of large/medium/small shapes, and I love how it resembles toadstools.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n^ Plumbogummite on pyromorphite, China (One of my favorites, love weird coatings, and how it resembles rotting wood.  Minerals that look like plants are kind of the best thing ever.)\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n^ Vanadinite on barite, Morocco.  I love how light and airy it feels.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n^ Chalcopyrite on \u201cfishscale\u201d calcite, China (I love pretending I\u2019m just a few mm tall, and imagining what it would be like to climb around on this.)\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n^ Microscope shot of a tiny detail of a strange piece of chalcedony from India.  I used a technique called focus stacking to capture its depth without the blurriness.\r\n\t\r\nDesign\r\nI really appreciate good design, whether it\u2019s architecture or everyday manufactured objects. I often see the time and consideration that went into them, it boosts my sense of general gratitude.\r\n      * This makes me some sort of materialistic, which is a neutral trait in my book as long as I\u2019m mindful to distance it from status games.\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy speculative projects (like academic architecture). \r\nEntertainment design is also such a cool field to me, as a participant and fan.  I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the past collecting thousands of images of inspiring design for video games/animation/film to reflect on. Always happy to share my scifi/fantasy concept art wallpaper collection.\r\n\tSystems\r\nI see beauty in systems, and communicating this is a primary artistic goal.  Especially when they\u2019re self-regulating, or have cool emergent properties.  \r\nI love procedurally generated art.  3D fractals have a powerful effect on me, especially.  I love the intersection between software and art.  If you just want to talk shop about modeling softw, generative AI, digital painting, or creative software in general, Hit.Me.Up.  \r\n\tMachine learning/AI\r\nI\u2019ve been tinkering around with generative AI imagery for around 9 years, now.  When using it, I feel more like a scientist-adventurer, exploring a brand new world, a Library of Babel.  It\u2019s so exciting to try stuff and plot out my own corner of latent space.  I\u2019ve been doing some public speaking and consulting with regards to how this tech can be hybridized with human creativity, and its impact on broader culture.  I have\u2026 a lot of thoughts on this stuff.  It\u2019s like jet fuel for conversations with other creative folks.\r\n\r\n\r\n@09-13-2024_AI-Design-Talk_KZ.mp4\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also been learning more about the fundamentals of AI (LLMs and such), and the alignment problem.  The best way I can contribute to this one is through science fiction, sparking new thoughts and general awareness.  (Ask me about the world of Synthara.)\r\n\t\r\n\r\nScience Fiction/World Building\r\nI love science fiction, and consuming and/or creating it is a big plus in a partner!  It would be great to discover and think up new works together.\r\nWorld building is a state of mind of sorts.  Thinking speculatively and tweaking parameters on the lived experience and imagining worlds in which that is the norm\u2026 it\u2019s a good way to understand life in general, and just makes living more fun.  (See above on Synthara.)\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPsychedelia\r\nI have always felt very attuned to the visual elements of psychedelia, before I even knew what it was.  Recursion, symmetry, intricate geometric patterns, scintillating color, weird fractal hyperdimensional stuff, all feel deeply ingrained in my psyche.  One of my earliest memories was drawing a kind of geometric kaleidoscope on a magna doodle. \r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ My middle school art was very psychedelic.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSo yeah, my art has nothing to do with psychedelic drugs, even though strangers sometimes ask me how many \u00b5g of acid I took to make one of my art pieces. I have certainly experimented in this realm, but my mind responds differently than what would be considered artistically useful.  \r\n(They\u2019re very interesting though, and I respect the people who do use them for creative ends.  My ideal partner would share my view that they are a net positive for humanity.)  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy sense of aesthetics comes in part from seeking novel ways to merge and weave these different elements into something new.  I\u2019ve enjoyed probing latent space (gen AI) for ways to merge seemingly disparate elements, and have generated tens of thousands of works in the process.  But drawing is still the most efficient way to express precise and direct vision, and I don\u2019t regret all the time spent learning to do it well.\r\n\tCollaboration\r\nCreative collaboration is a big part of bonding for me.  \r\n\r\nWhen I think of an ideal partnership, it would involve working on a shared project(s) of some kind.  Doesn\u2019t have to be a successful commercial IP (although that would be awesome).  Really, it can be anything in which both people are able to express themselves honestly, and weave that into a harmony greater than the sum of its parts.  It\u2019s a crystallization of the communication between both people.  As a bonus, such a thing can strengthen a relationship by acting as a safe place to test conflict resolution when creative differences arise.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe brainstorming process is particularly special.  I like to call it \u201csparking.\u201d I have never regretted the time and energy spent on it, even when the majority of those conversations don\u2019t lead anywhere tangible.  The positive feedback loops of enthusiasm while mutually branching into a possibility space is a beautiful thing in and of itself.\r\n\tLearning\r\nI love learning, and devour audiobooks!  I listen to them while working (when the task at hand is text-minimal), while exercising, doing chores, and commuting. I just really enjoy the process of absorbing new stuff and updating my model of the world.   \r\n\r\n\r\nI have been focusing mostly on general nonfiction on a broad range of topics, but historically I\u2019ve gone through a lot of science fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull disclosure:  My retention of specifics is not very good when I learn this way, but the main intention is to eliminate unknown unknowns.  I have a better sense of the world at large, and enough knowledge about many things to put in the appropriate keywords for a deeper dive should I ever want or need to.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of my text consumption comes in the form of:\r\n      * Essays/blogs, usually rationalism-related somehow (I sub to ACX and LessWrong, but I am not hardcore.)\r\n      * Asking LLMs things\r\n      * Graphic novels\r\n      * Art/making-of books\r\n      * Technical guides\r\n\r\n\r\nI also like watching EduTubers, too.  There\u2019s some quality stuff out there.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\u2014-----------------\r\nGender\r\nFirst off, androgyny in others is really hot to me, both physical and mental/behavioral.  Especially if the person strives to master both modalities without seeing them as zero-sum.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nI have a lot of thoughts on gender and my queerness thereof.  \u201cAgender\u201d feels like a decent word to describe how I feel.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, I can do the gender thing and it's often enjoyable.  \r\nOperating in Woman Mode is like taking a vacation. It's fun, even feeling extravagant. But over extended time, it can be draining and the comfort of home calls. The same can be said about Man Mode.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut gender isn't just a game, mask, or box.  It's a series of frameworks/lenses for interfacing with the world, and different situations call for different ones.  I ultimately strive for the best of both.  In my ideal existence, everywhere is home, and nobody wears masks.  If people are innately inclined towards one modality or another, education would help them find balance by mastering both.\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI, the pronouns she/her don't distress me, and correcting them in social settings isn't generally worth the friction.  But they/them feels more accurate and is appreciated, and I will use them when given an explicit opportunity.  I used to have physical dysphoria, but have taken action to rectify it and now feel quite comfortable in my body.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a bit of a xenogender, too.  I\u2019ll just leave that there\u2026\r\n\t\u2014-----------------\r\nRomance and Intimacy\r\nAs a partner, I will view you as a teammate and stretch myself to understand your viewpoint.  I will happily participate in mutual emotional support.  If I detect any kind of imbalance, I will communicate this with as much clarity as I can so we can easily course-correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope that as a unit, we push ourselves to be better as individuals, to fight the path of least resistance and keep each other on our toes.  To create and update a unified model of the world and share the cognitive load.  And that the hard path towards excellence will be made easier by lots of laughter, banter, and oxytocin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ The most romantic photo I have, and also the oldest one here.  Not really my vibe anymore, but what the heck.\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI, I'm into romantic role reversal.  Expect a good deal of admiration and affection of a dominant nature. I like the dance between taking the initiative and being initiated on, especially when the switch points are unpredictable.  Specifically a dance where the lead-role inflection points happen with underlying chaotic rhythms that neither party can fully predict, but both know how to sense and roll with.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that is a means to say that if I find you cute, you'll find yourself pinned to a wall sometimes. Hope you're OK with that.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s avoid codependency. In practice, there will still be reasonably frequent contact. But knowing I have the space to detach if desired is important.   \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m open to marriage and it seems like it would be a wonderful thing under the right circumstances, but it\u2019s not a requirement for a fulfilling life.\r\n\tExclusivity\r\nCommitted-yet-open relationships make the most sense to me intellectually.  I am not possessive of one\u2019s affection and how they express it, although I would want some kind of minimum amount of quality time in a serious relationship.  (Love is not a zero sum game, but time is.)  It\u2019s also worth noting that I am seeking a primary partner right now, and wouldn\u2019t consider ENM until there was a mutually solid foundation to build from.\r\n\r\n\r\nPut another way, it is in the relationship\u2019s best interest if both (or more) people are as happy and satisfied as they can be, and the chance of one person being able to meet all the needs is not 100%.  Just communicate tightly, truthfully and explicitly, and we should be good.  But I\u2019m OK with full exclusivity if it\u2019s important to my partner, and everything lines up to support it.  \r\n \r\ntl:dr: I see the benefits of either mono or poly relationships, and would be happy with either depending on the partner.\r\n\tOrientation\r\nWhen lumping romance and intimacy together, I\u2019d put myself on the straight side of pan.  (Kinsey scale 2.) \r\n\r\n\r\nI can see a timeline in which I end up in a long-term romantic relationship with a female-identified person, but I\u2019d put the probability at ~<5%.  Part of it is simple demographics, and part is that I have found shared interests, attraction, and overall chemistry to be more difficult to align simultaneously with womanly people.  But this is ultimately case-by-case.  If you\u2019re far on the feminine side of the spectrum, know that it\u2019s still theoretically possible, and would make a cool story about how we overcame the odds.  \r\n\tPast\r\nI don\u2019t have many exes, but 100% of my relationships have ended amicably.  My last relationship of 4 years ended amicably in 2023.  I am still close friends with him, though he now lives pretty far away.  I expect him to play a role in my life for the foreseeable future.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\u2014-----------------\r\nLifestyle/Work\r\nI usually have location freedom unless summoned to a stint at a studio (rare, post-covid).  I did a lot of travel to different US cities selling my art at conventions, especially before April 2020, but I don\u2019t consider myself to be especially well-traveled in terms of actually living in very different environments.  I\u2019d like to open up more on this front.  I\u2019ve still been relatively nomadic lately (no permanent lease in SF yet), and know how to live out of a suitcase.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy default state is working a lot, although work and play can often intertwine in my field.  I\u2019m currently on a soft sabbatical, meaning that I\u2019ve become a lot pickier about the work I take on, and dropped the convention sales circuit this year so that I can focus on my own vision, new skills, and recover from some burnout. I\u2019m financially secure from living below my means for many years, and very happy to have time to take a step back and figure out how to navigate the rapidly changing creative industry.  I am optimistic about my long-term career situation because of the way I solve problems and see opportunities in general, but it\u2019s especially hard to predict things right now.\r\n\tAdventure\r\nI like being active!  Being active in nature is even better.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClimbing is one of my favorite things to do, and has been all my life!  Trees, rock scrambling/light bouldering, top rope at climbing gyms\u2026 I\u2019m an acrophile.  I feel more comfortable from a vantage point and a trickle of adrenaline in my veins.  \r\n\t  \r\n\r\nI really love hiking, and I do it less than I wish.  Nature is insanely dense with form/color/composition/system/everything-else inspiration.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nI also like dancing to EDM!  It\u2019s uplifting, and really good exercise.  Dance floor unity is a wonderful thing when it happens.  Some genres I\u2019m into: progressive psytrance, world psybass, breaks/glitch hop, and good ol\u2019 house if they keep it interesting.  If you know of any good rave scenes in SF along these lines, and you want a dance buddy, hit me up.  \r\n\t  \r\n\r\n^ At Lightning in a Bottle a couple years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve attended a fair number of underground arts/EDM festivals to install art, and also let loose and really push myself physically.  My step counter record is ~55,000 steps in a waking period (~45,000 in a 24-hour period).  There\u2019s something about the hyperstimulation to all the senses in these places that\u2019s comforting and energizing at the same time.  Ideal frequency of such events would be 2X/year.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n^ Obligatory Burning Man pic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nMedia\r\nMusic is awesome.  There\u2019s a lot of music I like, especially electronic.  I love weird sound synthesis and layered production.  Also classical, and instrumental folk are good, too.  \r\nI like animation and graphic novels for visual storytelling over live action film/TV.  But I don\u2019t watch much passive media in general.  I\u2019m more inclined if cuddling with someone though.\r\n\r\n\r\nGames\r\nI highly respect games as a medium, and have been slowly retooling towards producing them directly.  Good game design as a form of beauty for sure.  I spent too much time on them in the past...  These days, I spend much less time playing video games recreationally.  The two games I\u2019ve played lately are Deep Rock Galactic for chaotic fun with friends, and Cracktorio as therapy to get over perfectionism and learn a bit about devops along the way.  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ The factory must grow.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nI also enjoy tabletop RPGs, but they are also a big time investment, so I don\u2019t anticipate anything beyond one-shots for a while.  I\u2019d love to DM sometime though, for a campaign set in my sci-fi world.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\u2014--------\r\nDomesticity\r\nI really like the idea coliving, and have a little experience with it already.  I\u2019m currently working to participate/build a kind of chosen family.  If you\u2019re reading this and think I\u2019d be a good fit for a group you\u2019re connected to, send me a message!  In the meantime, I\u2019m planning to sublet from others until I have a better-formed long term plan.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ I\u2019ve given some thought to this coliving thing.  Here\u2019s a concept for what it could be like in the relatively-near future\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAs a domestic partner, I\u2019m conscientious and reasonably neat, and find the process of cleaning to be rather enjoyable.  I do tend to drop clutter bombs when in a hurry to leave or when deep in a project, but don\u2019t typically leave those out for long.  I\u2019m capable of living in small spaces without going crazy. I cook, but am not super into it and my skills are pretty basic.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\u2014--------\r\nProcreation\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm leaning against having kids. I have optimized for different skills than what parenting demands, and think I can have a more positive impact/personally meaningful life if I really push the boundaries of my strengths rather than branching into that realm.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, I do like kids and playing some kind of support role would be nice, perhaps as part of a chosen family in some form, or adoption if I change my mind much further down the line.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFamily history indicates that I still have plenty of time to make this decision, but I'm currently operating under the assumption that I will be going childfree when it comes to medium-term planning/goal-setting.  If my partner were to take a primary role in the childrearing and other factors lined up correctly, it would help sway me, but the chance of bio-kids is currently ~5% and adoption ~20%.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily\r\n\r\n\r\nI am pretty close to my nuclear family and spend more time with them relative to the average American, typically living with them for months out of the year.  It works, even though they are comically different from me in many ways.  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\u2014--------\r\nPhysical Traits\r\nHealth\r\nMy overall health is good, and I expect to live a long life.  Conditions meeting the diagnosis threshold fall short of the dealbreaker threshold for reasonable romantic partners.  \r\n      * I have an uncommon genetic mutation...  which makes leafy greens taste better.  I'll take it!\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm reasonably active and eat nutrient-dense food.  I eat meat, but at a reduced consumption level with a focus on fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love climbing gyms, but haven\u2019t stuck with it since arriving in SF.  Running is a go-to for cardio.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough my spindlyness means I tend to run cold.  \r\nShared body heat is heaven on earth.\r\nI tend to steal the covers while unconscious.  \r\nYou have been warned.  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\u2014--------\r\nHeight See what I did there\r\nI love my height!  I find the benefits outweigh the disadvantages on a practical day-to-day basis.  I'm 1/16th stick insect, mother's side.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a preference for folks who are relatively close to my height in either direction.  It makes eye contact and hugs more direct, but I can bend on this. hah\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n^ (Source:  Gigacalculator)  (Another said 99.973.  I\u2019m inclined to trust it more, but it didn\u2019t have this pretty graphic.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014--------\r\nFashion\r\nI enjoy playing with fashion.  My style could often be described as \u201cadventurer-from-a-cyber-solarpunk-future.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nI like mixing styles/eras. Old-style cardigan + fractal-alien-spaceship-engine print lets GOOOOO!\r\n\r\n\r\nHats: Yes\r\nPendants: Yes\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitics and Religion\r\nThis doc is long enough as it is, lol.\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nOK fine, here are some tidbits.\r\n      * I consider myself EA (or the classic \u201cEA Adjacent\u201d) and donate to organizations that align with it.\r\n      * I worry a lot about AI making inequality even worse than it already is, and/or crystallizing it.  I don\u2019t really know what to do about it..  \r\n      * I\u2019m relatively Longtermist.\r\n      * On the left side of libertarian, if I had to choose a quadrant.  \r\n      * Not into organized religion, but spiritual, or at least strive to be.  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nContact\r\nIf you made it to the end, thank you for the time and consideration.  And as a reminder, I\u2019m also seeking friends or just one good conversation, so hit me up.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you liked this profile, just contact me at: \r\n6kpqjfea@duck.com",

I work as a software engineer.\r\n\tPersonality bucket\r\n\tINTJ (architect)\r\n\tInterested in\u2026\r\n\tMen, aged 28~35\r\n\tLooking for\u2026\r\n\tMonogamish primary life partner\r\n(more context in the section on \u201cWhy I\u2019m available\u201d here)\r\n\tKids?\r\n\t80% not interested in having children\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019d love to do with my life\u2026and you!\r\n* I want to really know you, and for you to really know me.\r\n   * I want us to finish each other\u2019s sentences, to breathe in synchrony.\r\n   * When we\u2019re apart, I want to be occasionally reminded of you in all the little things I see around me.\r\n   * I want to know what you like, so I can surprise you with little gifts of food when I go out shopping.\r\n   * I want to find you your favorite tea, and for you to be able to make me the perfect cup.\r\n* Let\u2019s dine out!\r\n   * I\u2019m a foodie.\r\n   * I don\u2019t mind dining out alone, but it\u2019s so much better with other people - you can have a conversation while waiting for the food; you can try more things from the menu; you can discuss how good (or not) it is compared to that other place.\r\n   * Find me delicious food I haven\u2019t tried before!\r\n   * I\u2019m happy to pay my share every time.\r\n* Let\u2019s travel!\r\n   * I would love to vacation 2~5 times a year together.\r\n   * I want to see buildings older than the USA. I want to take pictures of nature (accessible via half-day hikes) and paint them after. I want to learn the history of another continent. I want to marvel that people who speak different languages and eat different foods and believe in different afterlives can still have so much in common.\r\n   * I can solo travel, but logistics are easier in a pair.\r\n   * I\u2019ll get us great deals on plane tickets. I just need a hand getting my carryon into the overhead bin.\r\n* Let\u2019s talk about really cool things while cuddling!\r\n   * I read more than 50 books a year. Let me give you the cliffnotes on the good ones!\r\n   * I audit lecture series when I find interesting topics being taught by good professors. I\u2019m currently enchanted by architecture, history, and behavioral biology. Do you want me to tell you my top 3 favorite man-made structures? Please please let me tell you about my top 3 favorite man-made structures!\r\n   * Also tell me about things that you find cool. Let\u2019s debate and discuss confusing questions. I like crying about things that are beautiful.\r\n   * Let\u2019s cuddle while doing all of the above.\r\n* Come with me to craft fairs and vendor festivals!\r\n   * Be my voice of reason and talk me out of buying all the cute things.\r\n   * But please be patient when I spend 10 min talking to a fellow artist about the best markers and how expensive good gouache is.\r\n* If you really gain my trust, I will show you my sketchbook.\r\n   * Not the pretty one, but the ugly one with all the experiments and all the scribbling and the broken hands and things that didn\u2019t quite work out.\r\n   * If you can tell me why that pose looks off, I will give you a kiss.\r\n* For a sense of my humor\u2026\r\n   * I drew a weekly comic strip for several years: https://www.instagram.com/workingasintendedcomic/\r\nImportant FYIs\r\n* I\u2019m looking for a long term monogamish primary partner.\r\n   * I want to become each other\u2019s favorite, most important friend. I will likely want to become nesting partners. I want to share our household, our interests, and our lives.\r\n   * I\u2019m open to having metamours if there\u2019s enough commitment and investment in the relationship between you and me.\r\n   * I\u2019m not looking for a friend-with-benefits or one-night-stands.\r\n   * I\u2019m not lonely. I\u2019m open to staying friends or just hanging out, if we don\u2019t find a romantic spark. However, I have limited social energy and I already have existing friend groups. By necessity, I have to be very selective in whom I spend more time with as friends if there\u2019s no significant chance to become primary partners.\r\n* I\u2019m not looking to have children.\r\n   * I\u2019m 80% sure about this. I think the ROI of kids is far too low for me. I would rather enjoy my time, energy, and money in other ways.\r\n   * There\u2019s a chance I could be persuaded otherwise, but there are some major hurdles we\u2019ll have to clear.\r\n* My current partner will remain a part of my life.\r\n   * More details about this in the section on \u201cWhy I\u2019m available\u201d here.\r\n   * You can read his review of me here.\r\n* I\u2019m very introverted.\r\n   * Many friends don\u2019t realize or even believe I\u2019m introverted, because in many situations I can be highly energetic, bold, and the opposite of shy.\r\n   * In reality, all human interactions drain my social battery, even those with a close partner (just to a much lesser extent). My battery runs out quite quickly and I need a lot of time to recharge.\r\n   * When my social battery is low or dead, I\u2019m that person petting the dog in the corner at parties. If I\u2019m caught in this situation, I would value a partner who can be a social filter and take charge of the small talks. I will chime in when I can, or just observe if I cannot.\r\n   * I\u2019m also physically affected by strong stimuli. Bright flashing lights, big crowds, and loud noises have a good chance of giving me headaches if I\u2019m not careful. I would love it if you reminded me to stay hydrated, or fished out a spare pair of earplugs when I\u2019ve forgotten mine.\r\n* I value independence. A few flavors of this:\r\n   * I\u2019m financially independent and want you to be too.\r\n   * I want a relationship where we\u2019re our own persons who can thrive separately but choose to support each other to reach greater joy and achievements.\r\n   * As an introvert, I prefer having space and time to retreat to by myself.\r\n   * I likely will want to sleep by myself most of the time.\r\n* I have a cat.\r\n   * You want a picture of the cat, don\u2019t you? You definitely earned it for making this far into this doc, so here you go: this is Omen, Biter of Legs, Chaser of Wire Toys, Overlord of the Bed, the Couch, and Everything - also the love of my life. She has roughly 40,000 nicknames.\r\n* I identify as demisexual, and on the gray ace spectrum.\r\n* I\u2019m not religious.\r\n   * I did not grow up in a religious environment, and no religion has adopted me.\r\n   * I both came up with and then defeated Pascal\u2019s Wager when I was 12.\r\n   * However, I absolutely adore visiting cathedrals and basilicas (ask me what\u2019s the difference!). Architectural marvels, all of them.\r\n* I do not drink, smoke, or do drugs of any sort.\r\n   * I\u2019m in fact allergic to alcohol.\r\n   * However, I\u2019m perfectly capable of having fun while stone-cold sober at a bar with not-so-sober friends.\r\nWhy I\u2019m available\r\nI met my current partner in college. We\u2019ve been primary ~exclusive partners for 10 years, living together for the last 5 years. In recent years, it\u2019s become more obvious that we want different kinds of relationships. Specifically, I\u2019m looking for a more committed and higher-engagement relationship than he is willing to provide. Our hobbies and interests also did not converge, so we\u2019re spending less time together than I\u2019d like.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe will be shifting to a secondary role as I grow closer to a new partner and potentially more like a close friend in the longer term. However, he is family, and he\u2019s not going anywhere anytime soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can read his review of me here.\r\nReaching out\r\nIf you got this far, first of all, thank you for taking the time to read about me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think we may be compatible, please fill out this form to get in touch.\r\nhttps://forms.gle/Ywsjv9518mas9sHq9",

I have a bachelor of arts in performing arts music, but I have never been compensated for anything remotely artistic in my entire life.  I have worked in the federal government for the last five years. In those five years, I\u2019ve been an airport security screener, a tax auditor and a project manager.  I currently live in South Orange County, California - I have previously lived in Arizona, Hawaii and various other parts of Southern California. I'm considering leaving California again within the next few years due to the cost of living - despite all of my family being here.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm 39 and I would consider an acceptable dating range to be someone in her late 20's to late 40's. I would only consider monogamy, and my deal breakers are smoked substances, recreational drug usage, and general meanness. I have never had a girlfriend though I\u2019ve lost track of the people I have met on OLD - I have been on OLD - off and on - since before swipe apps were a thing. I\u2019m hoping this longer form word doc does a better job of actually marketing myself to someone who finds my flavor of weird adorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nI go back and forth between wanting to chuck my career to pursue global nomadic life (with a partner) or just find a kind and interesting person to settle in one spot with. (Because maybe I should just be grateful for all the places I\u2019ve been able to travel to in the past?) Perhaps it will end up something in between.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like going for scenic walks and being near, on, or in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of me loves nothing more than a grand adventure. I\u2019ve been to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, I rented an AirBNB restored trailer in somebody's yard for 28 nights (monthly discount!), explored Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon, and soaked in Iceland's Blue Lagoon (though the skies did not cooperate and I could not see the Aurora Borealis....)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's not to say I don't enjoy life closer to home. Sometimes exploring the world looks like finding a new restaurant and trying something new on the menu. I also love going to classical music concerts, and enjoy being a spectator or participant in numerous sports.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a partner to share life's moments with, both large and small. My ideal relationship emphasizes quality time, mutual respect, affection, and straightforward communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tend to prefer one on one and smaller group socializing over large group hangouts, but I can hang in the large ones on occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've been planning my own life for the past 20ish years. I'm more than ready to share the burden with someone else who wants to take it on. Even better if you\u2019re the planner type because I tend to be pretty go with the flow - though clearly I\u2019ve planned everything for myself for a long time, so I am capable and willing to do some planning.   :) \r\n\r\n\r\nI do not have any kids, and I\u2019ve never had a burning desire to be a parent. For that reason, I don\u2019t think that I would be compatible with someone who definitely wants kids. I look forward to a future where I can take advantage of last minute travel deals and don\u2019t need to schedule my life around a structured work schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not consider myself religious, but I was raised religiously Lutheran and I do in fact have some Ashkenazi Jewish in me according to a spit test of my DNA.\r\n \r\nI\u2019ve been part of the FIRE community for a while, and I lean frugal - but I\u2019m not rigid about that and I\u2019m willing to compromise to some extent to avoid a perpetual single life. :D I can\u2019t imagine ever needing to receive financial support from a romantic partner - and I\u2019m definitely not looking for a \u201ctraditional gender roles\u201d scenario - I very much would like to give and receive an abundance of emotional support and physical affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nI prefer warm temperatures and I am sensitive to the cold. For whatever reason, this seems to be the opposite of a lot of the people who I meet. I love going for walks by the ocean - the last time I went to Maui, I walked 7 miles every day on the boardwalks which proved that my sedentary life in gloomy coastal California is entirely a choice and not a physical limitation. I guess cold temperatures and cloudy skies do not inspire me to get my walking on. :D I have never lived somewhere with actual winter, but I'd certainly be willing to try it. One of my friends tells me I need to move to the East Coast to find the type of person who will appreciate me, but perhaps I just need to find someone from the east coast who has decided to make the trek to somewhere warmer. The heat didn\u2019t really bother me in Phoenix until it got above 105 degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I'm looking for someone who does actively want a partner like I do - not one of those with the mindset of \u201cif it happens, it happens\u201d - I don't want to build some full life for myself and then try to fit someone else into whatever little room might be left - I want to build an awesome life with someone else, together - I hope it\u2019s you, because I\u2019m pushing 40 and it would be great to meet you sooner rather than later.",

involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.  \",\n    \"Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. \",\n    \"He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. \",\n    \"Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful

out about the Potters. \",\n    \"Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. \",\n    \"The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. \",\n    \"The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. \",\n    \"This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a

would soon be happening all over the country. \",\n    \"Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.  \",\n    \"None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.  \",\n    \"At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek,

emerald-green cloak! \",\n    \"The nerve of him! \",\n    \"But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that

window in his office on the ninth floor. \",\n    \"If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. \",\n    \"He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. \",\n    \"Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. \",\n    \"Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. \",\n    \"He yelled at five different people. \",\n    \"He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. \",\n    \"He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.  \",\n    \"He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks

excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. \",\n    \"It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.

wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.  \",\n    \"He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. \",\n    \"He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. \",\n    \"Potter wasn't such an unusual name. \",\n    \"He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. \",\n    \"Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. \",\n

sister. \",\n    \"He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...  \",\n    \"He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.  \",\n    \"\\\"Sorry,\\\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. \",\n    \"It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. \",\n    \"He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. \",\n    \"On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \\\"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! \",\n    \"Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! \",\n    \"Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\\\"  \",\n    \"And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.  \",\n    \"Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. \",\n    \"He had been hugged by a complete stranger. \",\n    \"He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. \",\n    \"He was rattled. \",\n    \"He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.  \",\n    \"As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. \",\n    \"It was now sitting on his garden wall. \",\n    \"He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.  \",\n    \"\\\"Shoo!\\\" \",\n    \"said Mr. Dursley loudly. \",\n    \"The cat didn't move. \",\n    \"It just gave him a stern look. \",\n    \"Was this normal cat behavior? \",\n    \"Mr. Dursley wondered. \",\n    \"Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. \",\n    \"He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.  \",\n    \"Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. \",\n    \"She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\\\"Won't!\\\"). \",\n    \"Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. \",\n    \"When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:  \\\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. \",\n    \"Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. \",\n    \"Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\\\" \",\n    \"The newscaster allowed himself a grin.\",\n    \"\\\"Most mysterious. \",\n    \"And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. \",\n    \"Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"Well, Ted,\\\" said the weatherman, \\\"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. \",\n    \"Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! \",\n    \"Perhaps people have been

into the living room carrying two cups of tea. \",\n    \"It was no good. \",\n    \"He'd have to say something to her. \",\n    \"He cleared his throat nervously. \",\n    \"\\\"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\\\"  \",\n    \"As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. \",\n    \"After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a

her crowd.\\\"  \",\n    \"Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. \",\n    \"Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \\\"Potter.\\\" \",\n    \"He decided he didn't dare. \",\n    \"Instead he said, as casually as he could, \\\"Their son -- he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"I suppose so,\\\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.  \",\n

sinking horribly. \",\n    \"\\\"Yes, I quite agree.\\\"  \",\n    \"He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. \",\n    \"While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. \",\n    \"The cat was still there. \",\n    \"It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.

he could bear it.  \",\n    \"The Dursleys got into bed. \",\n    \"Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. \",\n    \"His last, comforting thought

\"How very wrong he was.  \",\n    \"Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. \",\n    \"It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. \",\n    \"It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. \",\n    \"In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.  \",\n    \"A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground. \",\n    \"The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.  \",\n    \"Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. \",\n    \"He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. \",\n    \"He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. \",\n    \"His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. \",\n    \"This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.  \",\n    \"Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. \",\n    \"He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. \",\n    \"But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. \",\n    \"For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. \",\n    \"He chuckled and muttered, \\\"I should have known.\\\"  \",\n    \"He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. \",\n    \"It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. \",\n    \"He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. \",\n    \"The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. \",\n    \"He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. \",\n    \"Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. \",\n    \"If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. \",\n    \"Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat.

   \"Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. \",\n    \"She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. \",\n    \"Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. \",\n    \"She looked distinctly ruffled.  \",\n    \"\\\"How did you know it was me?\\\" \",\n    \"she asked.  \",\n    \"\\\"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\\\" said Professor McGonagall.  \",\n    \"\\\"All day? \",\n    \"When you could have been celebrating? \",\n    \"I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\\\"  \",\n    \"Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.  \",\n    \"\\\"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,\\\" she said impatiently. \",\n    \"\\\"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something's going on. \",\n    \"It was on their news.\\\" \",\n    \"She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. \",\n    \"\\\"I heard it. \",\n    \"Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... \",\n    \"Well, they're not completely stupid. \",\n    \"They were bound to notice something. \",\n    \"Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. \",\n    \"He never had much sense.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"You can't blame them,\\\" said Dumbledore gently. \",\n    \"\\\"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"I know that,\\\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \",\n    \"\\\"But that's no reason to lose our heads. \",\n    \"People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\\\"  \",\n    \"She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \",\n    \"\\\"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. \",\n    \"I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"It certainly seems so,\\\" said Dumbledore. \",\n    \"\\\"We have much to be thankful for. \",\n    \"Would you care for a lemon drop?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"A what?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"A lemon drop. \",\n    \"They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of\\\"  \\\"No, thank you,\\\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops. \",\n    \"\\\"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -\\\"  \\\"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? \",\n    \"All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\\\" \",\n    \"Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \",\n    \"\\\"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' \",\n    \"I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.  \",\n    \"\\\"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \",\n    \"\\\"But you're different. \",\n    \"Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"You flatter me,\\\" said Dumbledore calmly. \",\n    \"\\\"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"It's lucky it's dark. \",\n    \"I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\\\"  \",\n    \"Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, \\\"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. \",\n    \"You know what everyone's saying? \",\n    \"About why he's disappeared? \",\n    \"About what finally stopped him?\\\"  \",\n    \"It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. \",\n    \"It was plain that whatever \\\"everyone\\\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. \",\n    \"Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.  \",\n    \"\\\"What they're saying,\\\" she pressed on, \\\"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow. \",\n    \"He went to find the Potters. \",\n    \"The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. \",\n    \"\\\"  Dumbledore bowed his head. \",\n    \"Professor McGonagall gasped.  \",\n    \"\\\"Lily and James... \",\n    \"I can't believe it... \",\n    \"I didn't want to believe it... \",\n    \"Oh, Albus...\\\"  \",\n    \"Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \",\n    \"\\\"I know... \",\n    \"I know...\\\" he said heavily.  \",\n    \"Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \",\n    \"\\\"That's not all. \",\n    \"They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. \",\n    \"But -- he couldn't. \",\n    \"He couldn't kill that little boy. \",\n    \"No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.  \",\n    \"Dumbledore nodded glumly.  \",\n    \"\\\"It's -- it's true?\\\" \",\n    \"faltered Professor McGonagall. \",\n    \"\\\"After all he's done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy? \",\n    \"It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"We can only guess,\\\" said Dumbledore. \",\n    \"\\\"We may never know.\\\"  \",\n    \"Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. \",\n    \"Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. \",\n    \"It was a very odd watch. \",\n    \"It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. \",\n    \"It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \\\"Hagrid's late. \",\n    \"I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"Yes,\\\" said Professor McGonagall. \",\n    \"\\\"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. \",\n    \"They're the only family he has left now.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?\\\" \",\n    \"cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \",\n    \"\\\"Dumbledore -- you can't. \",\n    \"I've been watching them all day. \",\n    \"You couldn't find two people who are less like us. \",\n    \"And they've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. \",\n    \"Harry Potter come and live here!\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"It's the best place for him,\\\" said Dumbledore firmly. \",\n    \"\\\"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. \",\n    \"I've written them a letter.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"A letter?\\\" \",\n    \"repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \",\n    \"\\\"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? \",\n    \"These people will never understand him! \",\n    \"He'll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"Exactly,\\\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \",\n    \"\\\"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. \",\n    \"Famous before he can walk and talk! \",\n    \"Famous for something he won't even remember! \",\n    \"CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?\\\"  \",\n    \"Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \\\"Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. \",\n    \"But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\\\" \",\n    \"She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.  \",\n    \"\\\"Hagrid's bringing him.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\\\"  \",\n    \"I would trust Hagrid with my life,\\\" said Dumbledore.  \",\n    \"\\\"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,\\\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \\\"but you can't pretend he's not careless. \",\n    \"He does tend to -- what was that?\\\"  \",\n    \"A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. \",\n    \"It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.  \",\n    \"If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. \",\n    \"He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. \",\n    \"He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. \",\n    \"In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.  \",\n    \"\\\"Hagrid,\\\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \",\n    \"\\\"At last. \",\n    \"And where did you get that motorcycle?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,\\\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \",\n    \"\\\"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. \",\n    \"I've got him, sir.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"No problems, were there?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around. \",\n    \"He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol.\\\"  \",\n    \"Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. \",\n    \"Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. \",\n    \"Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.  \",\n    \"\\\"Is that where -?\\\" \",\n    \"whispered Professor McGonagall.  \",\n    \"\\\"Yes,\\\" said Dumbledore. \",\n    \"\\\"He'll have that scar forever.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"Even if I could, I wouldn't. \",\n    \"Scars can come in handy. \",\n    \"I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. \",\n    \"Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with.\\\"  \",\n    \"Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.  \",\n    \"\\\"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?\\\" \",\n    \"asked Hagrid. \",\n    \"He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. \",\n    \"Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.  \",\n    \"\\\"Shhh!\\\" \",\n    \"hissed Professor McGonagall, \\\"you'll wake the Muggles!\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"S-s-sorry,\\\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \",\n    \"\\\"But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead -- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -\\\"  \\\"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,\\\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. \",\n    \"He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. \",\n    \"For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.  \",\n    \"\\\"Well,\\\" said Dumbledore finally, \\\"that's that. \",\n    \"We've no business staying here. \",\n    \"We may as well go and join the celebrations.\\\"  \",\n    \"\\\"Yeah,\\\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \\\"I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. \",\n    \"G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.\\\"  \",\n    \"Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.  \",\n    \"\\\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\\\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. \",\n    \"Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.  \",\n    \"Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. \",\n    \"On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer.

other end of the street. \",\n    \"He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.  \",\n    \"\\\"Good luck, Harry,\\\" he murmured. \",\n    \"He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.  \",\n    \"A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. \",\n    \"Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. \",\n    \"One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... \",\n    \"He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed

Now, I have settled into a beautiful home \\nand have cultivated an appealing lifestyle.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, like a tropical bird in a David Attenbourough documentary, I expect my efforts will create mating opportunities soon.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Third</strong>, I am offering a specific life that's off the beaten path and have high, admittedly out-of-date standards for my partner.

After all, I only need to find one.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBonus reason! When women actually ask me this, I give this exact answer. I could say something appropriate like: \\n</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\\"I haven't found my match yet, but I liked your profile!

    ProfileText: "Hi, I'm Harry!\nHi, I'm Harry!\nNote: You may prefer to see my profile on\nthis other useful website\n, which has both more detail and more pictures of me.\nHi! I'm Harry Altman, aka Sniffnoy.  You might have encountered me on the\n    internet before.  I do math, and in particular I can talk your ear off about\n    the problem of writing numbers with ones, addition, and multiplication!  And\n    lots of variants of the problem.  I won't do that here though, I'll save\n    that for later.  :D\nAlso I like infinities.  I've also been working a bunch on doing silly\n    things with infinities.  This is actually much easier, but unfortunately\n    it's way harder to explain to people!  Again, best saved for another time.\n    :)  Also various other math things, like some neat Fibonacci things\n    recently, but, uh, this isn't supposed to be a research statement, so I'll\n    move on to a different topic. :P\nI don't actually have an academic position anywhere, so this past 5 years\n    I've worked a programming job to support my math habit. :)  I was writing an\n    Ethereum smart contract debugger, if you're interested; but that's come to a\n    close now so now I have a lot more time to get other things done again!\nOK so the thing is... like, I guess this is a place to describe oneself,\n    but I'm kind of averse to doing that?  I guess a big thing there is that I\n    worry about verbal overshadowing and also creating fixity, that by\n    describing myself I will thereby cause myself to identify with those\n    descriptions, which is something I want to avoid.\nSo, well, I guess I will try to say only things that are quite definitely\n    true, or to show rather than telling!\nI guess, I like things that are a bit off from what people expect.\n    Sometimes, as in my mathematical work, these things are quite natural -- but\n    nature doesn't always meet your expectations!  Or (to take a page from\n    Yudkowsky's book), I should say that people's expectations don't always meet\n    nature. \ud83d\ude01  Sometimes nice questions have nasty answers, and I like to\n    disgust people with them. :D  And sometimes nasty-seeming constructions have\n    nice results, and I like to amaze people with them!\nBut I'm interested in the artificial as well as the natural; a thing I\n    find really fascinating is, like, bizarrely complicated conventions and\n    understanding where they come from and all the weird cases they generate.\n    Things like text encoding (particularly Unicode) and data encoding in\n    computers; unusual calendars (it's fun to explain the Hebrew calendar to\n    people \ud83d\ude01); and other such things.  I am trying to more often say \"huh,\n    that's a strange word, I wonder where it comes from?\" and look up its\n    etymology.  So many things that appear to not make sense, the reason is, it\n    used to make sense, but then it wasn't updated when circumstances changed!\n    And I really like learning about the history of how that occurred.\nI also like taking pictures of the local wildlife, which mostly means\n    bugs and birds. :)  Here in New York mostly birds, I don't see a lot of good\n    bugs here.  Although there are rats! :D  Of course, rats don't like light or\n    people, which makes photographing them tricky, but it can be done!  Back in\n    Ann Arbor I'd see a lot more good bugs.\nUh, what are other good stories for illustrating myself?  Um, here's one\n    that comes to mind.  Once, I was visiting my friends Colin and Aviva out in\n    Chicago, and we were in the car, along with their dog, Gately.  (Gately has\n    since died, unfortunately.)  I was in the back seat, and Gately was in the\n    center of the car.  And I thought, you know, dogs are always sniffing each\n    other's butts. Gately's butt is right there; I could totally sniff it.  So\n    uh I tried sniffing Gately's butt.  It stunk!  Not that much though.  I\n    don't think I really learned anything from doing this. :P\n(Perhaps my favorite thing that anyone has ever said about me: \"Harry,\n    you are very good at making arguments, but you are not good at not doing\n    annoying things with the cat toy.\" \ud83d\ude01)\nMe elsewhere on the web\nMy homepage\nThis is where you can find my papers and other neat little\n                things.\nMy Dreamwidth\n                blog\nMostly just a silly personal blog, I also write about math here\n                and sometimes other thoughts.\nMy Facebook\n                profile\nThis is where I post all my pictures! Um, although if you don't\n                at least know someone in common with me, I guess you mostly\n                won't be able to see them.  Sorry.

    ProfileText: "\ufeff* Name: Mateusz.\r\n* Born: 1998.\r\n* Height: 180 cm.\r\n* Orientation: Straight.\r\n* Relationship style: Mono/Poly (in the process of being determined).\r\n* Location:\r\n   * Currently \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf1 but probably Tallinn \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddea starting ~2024-10-28.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am mainly (and ultimately) interested in a primary long-term romantic relationship. I'm also open to short-to-mid-term dating in the meantime (including as a build-up to something longer).\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me / personality\r\n\r\n\r\nI am somewhat agentic and more generally, I have a somewhat optimizer-y approach to life; aiming to figure out what I want and how to ensure what I want to happens. (Obvious reflective caveats that I'm not sure what I want, what I want changes, I have limited optimization power and so on.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI like this aspect of my personality and aspire to be even more agentic.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were to point out the thing(s) that I like the least about myself, it would be (1) being too compliant/conflict-{aversive,avoidant}; (2) succumbing to the feeling of urgency that makes me try to move too fast with stuff, despite knowing that \"slow is smooth is fast\".\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a LessWrong'er,[1] Effective Altruist, and atheist/naturalist. I have a strong interest in religions and (for lack of a better word) spiritual traditions and what we might be able to learn from them for wise living and adapting culture. Other communities that I haven't explored much but would like to and am pulled toward include RadicalxChange/\u2ffb Plurality, Game-B, and Evolving Ground. It's probably fair to call me a transhumanist.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people told me something like \"are you Asperger's?\" or \"come to me today; you'll meet my other autistic friend\". I don't have a diagnosis. I know some people who seemed to me to be less autistic than myself but got the diagnosis nevertheless. Do what you want wish with that information.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality: I'm above 90th percentile on Openness and Conscientiousness, 80th-ish percentile on Agreeableness, Extraversion, Honesty-Humility, and Emotionality/Neuroticism.\r\nDrug use: I don't drink or smoke. I sporadically use nicotine gums/tablets for instrumental reasons (e.g. energy boost or enhance habit formation). I've had ~20 psychedelic trips. I mostly don't do drugs these days.\r\nDiet: Mostly vegan (primarily for ethical reasons and due to habit).\r\nChronotype: Morning lark. I typically go to sleep early and wake up around 06:00-07:00 and start the day with a workout and meditation. I let myself loose during social events/retreats/parties etc.\r\nCommunication style: I mostly dislike smalltalk and prefer direct, tactful communication over indirect communication (ask/tell culture-ish over guess culture-ish). I sometimes ask weirdly specific questions just because I'm curious (a friend once commented on it: \"you don't ask, you send requests\").\r\n\r\n\r\nWeird compliments I've gotten\r\n\r\n\r\n* High signal-to-noise ratio.\r\n* Quick reaction time in communication.\r\n* Ontological vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeird accomplishments\r\n\r\n\r\n* Halfway through high-school I switched schools without the knowledge of my parents in order to be able to homeschool myself. It required me to jump through a bunch of hoops, the parents reacted with horror (yes, I should have played it out differently), but in the end it all worked out well; it was definitely a better decision than staying in \"normal high school\" (which would have lead me to moderate depression).\r\n* A friend of mine offered 50\u20ac to whoever shows them how they can be de-anonymized based on publicly available information. I won 50\u20ac.\r\n* I made up the extension of the acronym ILIAD (the first theoretical AI alignment conference), which became the official one.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I like to do\r\n\r\n\r\n* Exercise, primarily calisthenics, and running, sometimes gym. Currently, I exercise somewhat intensely every morning. I like trying out new forms of physical activity/play.\r\n* Expand my understanding and skills: math, programming, biology, history, philosophy, doing-things-effectively.\r\n   * I especially like a lot learning with somebody else, reading from a textbook aloud, staring together at the whiteboard, trying to understand the leaps of logic made by the author.\r\n* Working together on a creative/coding project.\r\n   * Deep/abstract/nerdy/philosophical conversations.\r\n   * Is The United States conscious?(Gong?)\r\n   * What is consciousness anyway and how much of a Thing is it? I was sympathetic to illusionism at some point. Then I read Deacon's book.[3] Now... it's complicated.\r\n* What would have happened if Assyrians succeeded in conquering Jerusalem in 701 BCE?\r\n* Is the Solomonoff prior malign?\r\n* Should we maximize helium?\r\n* Where does (the feeling of) effort come from?[4]\r\n* List of my favorite stuff and favorite metal playlist.\r\n* Mindwork\r\n   * Meditation (regularly; want to get seriously better at it), psychedelics.\r\n* Reading fiction.\r\n* Stuff that you could call therapy but I like a broader term like \"mindwork\" (working with the mind so that it functions better). I'm currently most interested in IFS and CBT.\r\n* Being around people who largely share my interests, attitudes, and values.\r\n\r\nThings I want to give a good try\r\n\r\n\r\n(This list is to be expanded.)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Participate in social experiments, e.g. new ways of organizing society, coliving/group houses?\r\n* Finally learn to play an instrument well (keyboard?), maybe understand music theory.\r\n* Scuba diving in a coral reef.\r\n* Learning a new language (especially one with a very different grammar from Polish/English, ~i.e. non-Indo-European).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I value\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you seen The Goddess of Everything Else? Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann? I think these are the two works of art that shaped [the way I orient emotionally toward the possibility of brighter future] the most. (I haven't read Progress and Poverty yet but I have some suspicion it may have a similar effect on me once I read it (hopefully/probably soon-ish).)\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't quite know what I'm fighting for. I know I want a world without disease and unnecessary suffering. I know I want Civilization/Humanity to wisen, improve, mature, become [more of what we want to be] and expand into the stars. I want us to decode the mysteries of the universe and mathematics, decode the hidden structure, create works of art and ingenuity beyond any description. I want to contribute whatever optimization power I can squeeze out to contribute to that project.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, I [identify with]/[am a member of] LessWrong and Effective Altruism.\r\n\r\n\r\nI dedicated my career to ensuring that arrival of non-human powerful minds will have good effects. For the last ~year, I've been focusing on what one might call \"solving the alignment problem\".[5] Although I'm still [thinking about]/[working on] it in some capacity, I recently concluded that it's currently better for me to work in AI safety strategy and that's what I'm shifting the bulk of time toward.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sympathize with consequentialist/utilitarian-ish vibes but I don't consider myself a consequentialist/utilitarian. Certainly, I am not a negative utilitarian, or antinatalist. I don't buy into The Repugnant Conclusion. I care about wild animal suffering but I also care about Green. I want to eliminate unnecessary suffering, but also view happiness as something between a proxy and only one component of The Good.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant in a partner\r\n\r\n\r\nMy ultimate romantic goal is to find a long-term partner who shares my values, and with whom I will build a co-constructive relationship, where both sides aid each other in becoming more of what they want to be and figuring out what they want to be. In the meantime (and for the purpose of finding such), I'm open to short-term and mid-term dating.\r\n\r\n\r\n(I'm currently open to both monogamy and polyamory but in the end I certainly want to settle on one of them, rather than anything in-between-ish, based on which one turns out to be more compatible with me (though leaning towards poly).)\r\n\r\n\r\n* I probably don't want to have children.\r\n* Open/transparent/direct communication, ask/tell culture, more so than guess culture.\r\n* Large overlap in core values.\r\n* Intelligence, creativity, curiosity, cultivation of intellectual activity.\r\n* Different from me in interesting ways.\r\n* Openness, conscientiousness, honesty and love of argument.\r\n* Love for physical displays of affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONSHIP DEALBREAKERS:\r\n\r\n\r\n- Demand to cease/[unnaturally downplay] close relationships with other people.\r\n- Doxastic violence (i.e. pressuring me or others to adopt or articulate views against one's best judgment/conscience).\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I want to live\r\n\r\n\r\n- Over the next two years, I'd like to finally settle somewhere somewhat permanently, most likely in (or nearby) a big city where a lot of AI alignment/LW/EA stuff is happening, so that I can do my work effectively.\r\n- Likely with a/the partner, or at least with a/the partner relatively nearby.\r\n- With strong community, including a substantial number of strong ties, nearby.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n\r\n\r\n- Email: [Last name of the famous Hobbit] + [My first name in English] + [at]gmail.com\r\n- Discord: matthewbaggins\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] I prefer \"LessWrong'er\" to the overloaded \"rationalist\".\r\n[2] If that's already TMI for you, you probably don't want to date me or befriend me very closely.\r\n[3] Which is not primarily about consciousness.\r\n[4] Yeah, there are papers on this kind of stuff, like this one, although I don't think it's particularly good.\r\n[5] I don't like the phrasing \"alignment problem\" though, for slightly complicated reasons which this margin is, sadly, too narrow to contain.\r\n[6] I'm also not certain whether Good is actually good as a concept.",

It's not that I haven't had any luck -- I've connected with some interesting people, but obviously nothing that has worked out well enough to stop me wanting to go back.\nI thought I'd write a profile (a \"\ndate-me doc\n\" of sorts) for those piqued enough by the very limited window provided by Hinge to want to get to know me more, but on second thoughts I thought I'd do something different. So here's a list of reasons NOT to date me:\nI'm married. No two ways about it: some time in 2005, I entered into a civil marriage, which is still valid on paper. The marriage didn't work out, and my wife and I have lived separately since 2018. Neither of us see the point in getting a divorce as of now, but this will obviously change if there's a good enough reason for it. Needless to say, neither of us has problems with the other seeking other romantic interests.\nSteinbeck once referred to poor Americans seeing themselves as \"temporarily embarrassed millionaires\". Well in my case the pandemic and its aftermath has found me in a similar circumstance of temporary embarrassment (which I hope is truly temporary). I work with languages and have freelanced all my working life -- something that worked just fine, despite the unavoidable ups and downs, until a few years ago. Every now and then, it does begin to look like things might pick up again, but only time will tell if they really do. So all you prospective sugar babies can happily walk right past me and I hope you manage to find your pot(belly) of gold. But for those of you who might still be willing to overlook this: I have never been that interested in making money or other indicators of worldly success. Right now, the only interest I still have in doing so is to uphold my commitment to my children (did I mention I have children? Well I do: two of the most wonderful persons I've ever had the pleasure of knowing).\nI can be a bit of a curmudgeon -- it's hard to get me excited about what's happening in the world outside (or even convincing me of its existence on some days), at least not for its own worth. In the right company, however, even the most humdrum, everyday activities take on the aura of the most exciting thing the world has ever known, and more than anything else, this quest of mine is for that right company.\nThat's it for now, but I'm sure there are many more reasons to weigh the prospect of seeing and going out (or staying in) with me very carefully. I promise to add them to the list as and when they occur to me.\nEdit\nPublish\nReport content on this page\nReport Page\nViolence\nChild Abuse\nCopyright\nIllegal Drugs\nPersonal Details\nOther\nPlease submit your DMCA takedown request to\ndmca@telegram.org\nCancel\nReport",

I\u2019m somewhat agnostic to location but have grown accustomed to the Mediterranean climate of the Bay Area. I\u2019m pretty close to my family and they play an important role in my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI grew up vegetarian and became vegan 10 years ago because I care about reducing animal cruelty. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker but I\u2019d prefer to be with someone who is plant-based or at least respects the decision I have made. I love to cook for others and people who have tried my cooking have said they could be vegan if they could have food like that all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\r\nSomeone family-oriented who is excited about finding a monogamous long term relationship leading to marriage/kids. I am open to biological children or adopting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone kind and empathetic who cares about helping other people and the world around them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who is interested in living a healthy and active lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who is passionate about something (work/hobbies/ideas). We don\u2019t have to share all of the same interests but we should be excited about supporting each other\u2019s passions and goals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who is open-minded to a little weirdness but still grounded in reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to live a comfortable but relatively simple lifestyle that values experiences over possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out!\r\nE-mail me at rsmohnot@gmail.com or DM me on Instagram or get an intro from someone I know (probably my brother who has like 5M friends).\r\nMore Pics\r\n  \r\n\r\nI organize a monthly walk and hang around a neighborhood in San Francisco for groups of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nFam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI was one of those people who got stuck in the mud at Burning Man in 2023.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI climbed this 100ft tall tree in Vancouver\r\n  \r\n\r\nI officiated my brother's burning man wedding in a dust storm while standing on a Funkadelephant, a giant mechanical elephant art car.\r\n  \r\n        \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nEaster egg for reaching the end: My sister in law INSISTED that I put this picture in - I\u2019m helping her move a really heavy console table up the stairs",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffJo\u00e3o\u2019s Date-me Doc\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! How fun is this? Date-me docs! Is that a great idea, or what? (no, really, I\u2019m actually asking)\r\nAbout me\r\nMy name is Jo\u00e3o. Don\u2019t worry about how to pronounce it. I\u2019m 5'8\" and 48 years old. I\u2019m Portuguese, but I\u2019ve been living in Cambridge (UK, not MA - sorry Massachutessans!) for over 10 years, where I work as a software engineer. Oh, almost forgot:\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the pictures are a few years old, but you can easily recognize the more recent ones by the amount of grey hair. I come complete with the dad-bod and the dad jokes, but no actual children. Trying to be more fit, but it\u2019s been a slow process, and the frequent travels to Portugal where the amazing food is very hard to resist don\u2019t help.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m more often in than out, but let\u2019s talk about out first: I enjoy going to the cinema, meeting friends at the pub, having fancy dinners, going for a nice walk. My geeky side also likes board games, escape rooms, bowling, that sort of thing. I was very keen on standup comedy in the past (and was once a standup comedian myself!) but haven\u2019t been there so much lately. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I\u2019m in, I\u2019m probably watching Netflix shows, or playing video games. If you\u2019re also a gamer, great, let\u2019s play something together; if you\u2019re not, don\u2019t worry, my gaming is always secondary to my dating, or any other social activity for that matter. Back to Netflix, I like mostly sci-fi, anything \u201cmind-bending\u201d, psychological horror, and (true or false) crime dramas, but I have a soft spot for sitcoms and romantic movies. I can also be found listening to podcasts while doing house chores, or doing homework for my Italian classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a firm believer that Everybody Likes Travelling\u2122 (admittedly some more than others), so that\u2019s really a non-question. My relationship with travelling is a weird one: I\u2019m not a travel-obsessed person but actually end up travelling a lot. I\u2019ve been to 4 continents (treating North and South America as 2) and 10+ European countries, but never to Paris. Or Ely, for that matter. I\u2019ve travelled alone before, but it\u2019s not the same without the right company.\r\n\r\n\r\nI live comfortably, have my own flat, live a peaceful and quiet life. I\u2019m independent, quite used to being on my own, simply looking for someone to go out with, talk to, share and care (and touch and kiss).\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\r\nMy phone. Almost every time. The keys are usually always at the same place but the phone could be anywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\nSeriously though. I\u2019m looking for a straight, monogamous, long-term relationship. I\u2019m not too picky, but be aware that I\u2019m probably writing a whole page detailing who I want you to be.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all, regardless of what you read below, if you\u2019re looking for friendship or just someone to talk to, go ahead and send me a message! I\u2019m friendly and a good listener, as long as you\u2019re not harassing me or asking me for money on the Internet.\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers: smokers and drug users (which is the minimum, really), covered in tattoos or piercings (one or two are fine).\r\n\r\n\r\nNo limits on age, height, race, but be aware that I\u2019m 48 and 5'8\". Some women like them tall and some women like them young and I\u2019m neither of those.\r\n\r\n\r\nProximity is important. If you live around Cambridge that\u2019s ideal; London and Essex are ok too. If you live further away, I think we better stay as friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are one or more of these things, that\u2019s fine, but be aware that I\u2019m not: vegetarian or vegan, religious or spiritual, right-wing, sports fan. I\u2019m very tolerant and accepting of other people\u2019s beliefs, convictions and lifestyles (and I like the occasional vegan meal), but I\u2019m not looking to change my own on these matters (ok, you might be able to convince me to get into sports).\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren are welcome: I like them and in general they tend to like me too. I don\u2019t have any and it\u2019s too late for me to get my own now. Grandchildren is where I draw the line - I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for that yet. If you don\u2019t have children, that\u2019s fine too, it means we have more time for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPets. I know some of you are very passionate about your furry friends. I like both dogs and cats but have none of them. The closest thing to a pet are Tom and Ada which are my tomato plants and are still surviving despite my inexperience with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for one person only. If only one of you replies to this and turns out to be the right one, that\u2019s enough for me. But of course that\u2019s in an ideal world, and in the pursuit of a long-term relationship sometimes we have to stumble in a few short-term ones. Also, I have a bit of trouble juggling different relationships even before the point of official exclusivity, so apologies if you get put on hold (I know, that\u2019s a terrible thing to say, and I\u2019m sorry) while I\u2019m dating someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, physical attractiveness, chemistry, sparks, these kinds of stuff are highly subjective but important (as I\u2019ve learned over the years). While in principle I don\u2019t discriminate between age, size, race, etc., if I don\u2019t feel physically attracted to you, or if I somehow feel that the chemistry is not there, then it\u2019s not going to work. That goes for you too, obviously.\r\nIf you\u2019re interested\r\nAn email would be great, to djeidot@gmail.com. As you can probably tell, I like people who write a lot. Search for djeidot on Instagram if you prefer to start with just a Hi and go from there.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffText me maybe? \r\nI read about Date Me Doc recently, and I was excited to get started. I try to make it as digestible as possible, if anything is not clear just ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n*       \r\n\r\nMy Story \r\n   * Age - Mid 30s\r\n   * Height - 5ft 7\r\n   * Sexual orientation - Straight, strictly monogamous \r\n   * Location: London, UK\r\n   * Languages - English, Mandarin, Korean, Malay, (want to learn Spanish)\r\n   * Human Design Type: Manifestor\r\n   * Attachment style : Fairly secure, tendency to be anxious\r\n   * Love languages: Beyond touch, act of service and words of affirmations; I seek stability, commitment and conscious communication\r\n   * What I can offer: Patience. Listening. Awareness. Conscious communication. Friendship. Independence. Space. Teamwork. Compassion. Reassurance. Personal and relationship growth. Shared memes. Comfortable Silence. Delicious food. Emotional and Physical Intimacy \r\n   * Life quest: learning how to swim, free-diving, own a 5-bed home, have family, and own a book cafe that encourages people to disconnect from their online world. \r\nMalaysian-born mixed-race life enthusiast, who finds joy in little moments and is passionate about personal and professional development. Single-handedly raised by my mother, I learned the values of resilience, determination and gratitude from an early age. Despite its challenges, my childhood was filled with beautiful memories, love, laughter and experiences. My academic journey took me to South Korea, and ultimately to UK, where I now call home. \r\nFamily holds a special place in my heart. I live with my mom since my last relationship, and remain in close contact with my brother, who\u2019s married. I have a close knit circle of friends and community, who I consider extended family \u2013 these connections ground me and remind the importance of love and support. \r\nImportant to know - I don\u2019t drink alcohol,but I have an active social life. I enjoy socializing in ways that foster deep conversations via conversation cards and shared experience. I enjoy hosting, inviting friends over for dinner or social events. In addition to that, I seek spiritual experiences such as cacao ceremonies, breathwork sessions, and forest bathing. These activities allow me to connect with my inner world, God, nature and explore different dimensions of consciousness, and deepen my appreciation for the world around me. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI love books - self growth, historical, geographical and autobiographies. I love random adventures, peace and quiet. I love everything about nature, indoor, outdoor spaces, fresh air. I love warm nights sleeping with the windows open.I am the type of person who gets excited about sunrises and sunsets, the night sky, thunder and the scent after the rain and engages in deep conversation while holding a mug filled with hot chocolates, sitting by the fire. I love not wasting. I love freshly squeezed orange juices. I love and I love and I hope I always keep on loving and choose love. \r\nI find joy in movements, of any sort - lately, I have been redefining my own limits and engaging a lot with salsa-bachata dancing, F45 exercises, Hyrox and the Turf Games competition. I also love reading, watching documentaries, and listening to podcasts - constantly expanding my knowledge and understanding of how this world works. \r\nWhat I am seeking:\r\nI want to connect, and genuinely get to know that person at a deeper level before we decide to embark on a journey called relationship. In my case, I am looking for my life partner. \r\nMy ideal partner is someone who shares similar values, which are non-negotiables \u2014fitness, family and growth mindset. Ideally, someone who appreciates physical, emotional and spiritual intimacy, physically active, adventurous, trustworthy, has the ability to be vulnerable, and appreciates PDA.Ideally my partner would:\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Prioritize family -I value maintaining strong ties with yours, my family and/or building family of our own. \r\n   * Want children - I want to have only one child and to conceive naturally. I love my life, enjoy travelling and I want to continue doing the things that bring me joy, finding my purpose in life and contributing to this world. I want to share these experiences with you and our children. Therefore, one is enough. I believe in natural order, and will not endure the pains and lengths of IVF or egg/embryo freezing to have children. \r\n   * Be physically active - Share my passion for physical activities and maintain healthy lifestyle. Love outdoor adventures.\r\n   * Growth and abundance mindset - embrace positive outlook of life, focusing on growth, gratitude and the belief that there is enough for everyone and there\u2019s solutions to every problem. \r\n   * Vulnerability and communication: I believe that having the ability to be vulnerable allows deeper intimacy. Conscious, open, honest communication is important to me. \r\n   * Kind - Display kindness not just towards me, but to everyone around you, me, us, including animals. \r\n   * Shared household responsibilities \u2013 be willing to contribute equally to household tasks and chores, as well as taking the initiatives to keep our relationship alive through planning dates and quality time together.\r\n   * Spirituality - Have a strong faith or spiritual practice, willing to do the deep work. Spirituality is an important part of my life and I would like to share /exchange that with my partner. \r\n\r\n\r\nDate Bucket List\r\n\r\n\r\n   1. Parkrun 9am Saturday & brunch\r\n   2. Farmer\u2019s market \r\n   3. Arcade fun \r\nQ&A with Bilqis\r\nConscious relationship agreement - core values (something I\u2019d like to have when we get into relationship)\r\n   1. No secrets - imagine our connections to each other like a living energy between us. I\u2019ve noticed that with most relationships the natural tendency is for this filmy layer to build up between us, small unspoken things or untruths only add to that layer and it becomes hard to truly see and feel close with each other. Radical honesty is a way of wiping away that layer between us. It keeps the connection clear. This doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t respect each other\u2019s privacy. \r\n   2. We are a team. As a team we get to play to our strengths. The ways we show up in our relationship are unique and there isn\u2019t an expectation that because I do X, you will do X. It\u2019s more about how can we both most authentically contribute and does that dynamic leave us both feeling nourished and supported. \r\n   3. No one outside the partnership knows more than we do. There isn\u2019t a single (consequential ) thing someone else could tell me that I don\u2019t already know. In moments of tension, instead of my first reaction being venting to friends, this practice has encouraged me to go inward first, to journal or speak to my partner to work through it. \r\n   4. No request or feeling is inherently \u201cwrong\u201d and everything can be talked about. Let\u2019s create a space that felt like freedom, not judgement. All requests and feelings are valid even if we can\u2019t meet that request in the moment. I want to feel safe to express my innermost thoughts and needs. It\u2019s also been an amazing practice in hearing someone without needing to fix or change, just listen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext steps, if you are interested in getting to know each other better, please do\r\n   * Drop me a line via IG @hej.bilqis or my LinkedIn profile\r\n   * Please include a link to your Date Me Doc and your photos if your Date Me Doc doesn't have them",

They must be climbed.\r\nI may have been a goat in a past life.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nWhy wear clothes?  \ud83d\ude09\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe far end of the fallen log hung suspended in the chasm.  By pumping your weight on it, you could make the whole thing bounce and spring like an enormous diving board.  Then, you'd feel like you were surfing in midair.  Great fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn a visit to Big Sur to see my dear friend Gary.  He and I go back to middle school.  His birth certificate says \u201cDorian\u201d.  One day, it was revealed to me by divine inspiration that Dorian's name is actually Gary Holcombe.  He felt confused at first, but he took to it pretty quickly.  Then, before long, he decided that my name is also actually Gary Holcombe.  We've been Gary and Gary ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat percentage of my life do I spend consuming text?\r\n\t  \r\n\r\nProof that my Kinsey score is actually 2.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAm I exploiting the bridge study by showing you a pretty sunset?  Maybe.  Maybe I am.\r\nNonfiction is magic\r\nThe first thing you should know about me is that I read SO. many. books.\r\nDo you read?  Eighty points of extra credit if you guzzle nonfiction too.  I want to hear from my fellow bookworms!  You can win my heart by talking to me about books.\r\nHere's an old list of books I considered life-changing when I read them.\r\nHere's a newer list of all the books I've finished in the last two years.  (The two lists don't overlap.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite subjects is \u201capplied psychology\u201d\u2014relationships, EQ, communication, motivation, parenting, and happiness.  I consider that genre one of the best tools for leveling up as a person.  What would the world look like if more people invested time in this?\r\n(Someone who knows me well looked at this part and said: \u201cYour special interest is relationships.\u201d  Take that as you will.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my other favorite subjects are: business, sociology, economics, neuroscience, cooking, sexuality, cultural history, memoirs, and many more.  The secret manual for life is sitting right here in plain sight!  And it's free!  Libraries are a point discontinuity in capitalism\u2014a 100% taxpayer-subsidized public good!  It's true what they say: teachers (including authors) can open a door, but it's up to each individual to walk through that door.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, my ideal partner is a curious lifelong learner who finds joy and meaning in continuous personal growth.  I dream of bringing out the best in each other for decades and decades.\r\nHelp me stay on track to master cooking?  Write poems?  Play instruments?  Compose music?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I help you stay inspired to do?  I want to be a person's rock while they grow toward their dreams.  I want to surprise my future spouse with little gifts to support their projects and interests.  If part of that looks like evangelizing books to each other, I'll be thrilled.  \ud83d\ude09\r\nWhat I'm like as a partner\r\n  \r\n\r\nEver since I saw this, I've been saying \u201cgeef\u201d and \u201cbeef\u201d in my head.\r\nSadly, the non-binary case has an awkward near-homophone.\r\nCould we say they're a \u201ctheef\u201d of hearts?\r\n\r\n\r\n* Super duper affectionate\r\n   * Near-constant stream of verbal and physical strokes\r\n   * Figuratively-never not touching you\r\n   * Will use pet names more than your legal name\r\n* Rotates through all five love languages\r\n* Generous with shoulder rubs\r\n* Practices and expects non-violent communication\r\n   * This is a hard requirement\r\n   * Git gud\r\n* Wants to play games\r\n   * As in Dominion with a capital \u201cD\u201d, not a lowercase \u201cd\u201d\r\n   * Please try as hard as you can to beat me\r\n   * Please actually be able to beat me (or be willing to learn / find fulfillment in sharpening your game)\r\n   * Sparring passionately in mind-sports is a profound form of intimacy & a peak human experience\r\n      * Goodness gracious, I want an energetic rival/lover who gives me a run for my money\r\n      * Remember that part in Atlas Shrugged where the young Dagny and Francisco are playing tennis?\r\n         * DISCLAIMER: I placed as a finalist (top 1% worldwide) in the Ayn Rand Institute's Atlas Shrugged essay contest, and will happily talk to you about why Rand is crucially mistaken about the basic mechanics of human psychology but nonetheless raises some interesting points that are otherwise unheard in politics and must be redeemed by nuanced thought and application that Rand herself would likely reject unless she's cooled her jets a bit in the afterlife\r\n         * If you found the above disclaimer unnecessary because you celebrate intellectual curiosity, critical inquiry, and literary cosmopolitanism, please message me already!\r\n   * I can still love my partner even if we don't spar in games, but it would be really great if we did\r\n* Wants to feed you\u2026and be fed by you\r\n* Excellent at playing unofficial therapist\r\n   * Yay, reflective listening and emotional literacy\r\n   * Have been told I\u2019m about as effective as a well-liked real therapist\r\n   * Would also support your seeing a real therapist\r\n* Wants to build you up and emotionally co-regulate you and see you thrive\r\n   * Your joy is my joy\r\n   * Let's achieve some power-couple dreams together!\r\n      * Build a dream house?  Start a business?  Raise a loving family?  Organize a conference?  Found an eco-village?  Go on a food tour of our ancestral homelands?  (Mine's Italy\u2014just saying.)  Compose a duet?  Revel naked under the full moon?\r\n* Clothing optional when it's just us at home\r\n   * The constant warm glow of intimacy from casual nudity with a partner is just\u2026yes\r\n\r\n\r\nA partner who racked up eight years with me (and is still my BFF) offered these suggestions to flesh out the list:\r\n\r\n\r\n* \u201cWonderful conversations.

Or some other city?  I don't know yet, and I want to find out.  I have yet to discover a subculture that shares all, or even most, of my core values.  ACX readers come the closest, but on average, they're missing relational warmth and vibrant affect.  Did I mention I'm a shameless glutton for cuddling and feelings?\r\n      * Update: I\u2019ve found an interesting match (somewhat, ish) with TPOT culture, and I\u2019m trying out the Hayes Valley neighborhood in SF!\r\n      * Update: TPOT culture lacks an intact contract of mutual care, and Hayes Valley ain\u2019t it.

How might we solve this as a family?\r\n* Monogamy/polyamory: let's talk\r\n   * I\u2019m looking for a stable home life and economic partnership, founded on an expectation of continuity and permanence, that hopefully doesn\u2019t ban me from enjoying physical affection and intimacy in my friendships.\r\n   * That means I would prefer some variant of ENM with the ideal reader of this doc (hey there, gorgeous!)\u2026\r\n   * \u2026but I would consider going monog if said partner needs it and is otherwise a bullseye match.\r\n   * Poly with me is smooth sailing if you're on board.\r\n      * I have eight years of experience with ENM.\r\n      * I've fully or partially read several of the standard poly texts.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\r\nCalling all nuanced thinkers\r\n\u201cThe ancient oracle said that I was the wisest of all the Greeks.\r\nIt is because I alone, of all the Greeks, know that I know nothing.\u201d\r\n\u2014Socrates\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's my favorite quote from Civilization V.  \ud83d\ude09\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual and emotional honesty take the cake in my value system.\r\n\r\n\r\nListening to diverse viewpoints, trying to empathize with others, sussing out the truth, sitting quietly with the finiteness of our knowledge, forming a responsible and carefully considered worldview, and holding skepticism toward our own biases are all deeply important to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI profoundly disagree with the existence of yard signs that show a pre-bundled collection of political slogans, even when I support each of the stated positions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I read Bowling Alone, I became a dues-paying member of Braver Angels and volunteered with BA as an event organizer and host.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy ideal partner would fit Paul Graham's description of an \u201caccidental moderate\u201d.  The more you wonder about and vibe with life experiences outside your own, the more I'd like to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThematically related.  Swiped from an Astral Codex Ten post about the regulatory\r\nchallenges facing bioengineered mouth flora that promise to eliminate cavities.\r\n\r\nYe olde ambitions\r\nI want to net eight figures (or more) over my lifetime by being amazing at tech and startups with reasonably prosocial impact.  This has been a long throughline in my life.  I taught myself to code at age eight.  Then I skipped college and went straight to work at Google, at age twenty.  In the ten years since, I've been building my business acumen, inhaling technical knowledge, developing a grand unified theory of engineering productivity, and attempting startups intermittently.  None of them have taken off yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the event of a wealth explosion: in addition to buying a lot of mosquito nets for charity, I'd like to create a beautiful, rejuvenating dwelling space that's quiet and green and close to a city and looks like something off Pinterest.  Maybe not just for me-and-mine\u2014maybe an eco-village?  A giant attic in which to keep brilliant neurodivergent artists and inventors?\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurodivergent liberation, beginning with my own, is a much bigger theme for me than status games.  I get a bad feeling in my gut about win/lose status games (though I'm admittedly driven to seek others' admiration and fondness)\u2014but I like living authentically and healthfully, and nurturing the same in the people whose lives I touch.  To the extent that those goals require resource abundance and social capital, they tend to get folded into conversations about status.  That can lead to some inner confusion, since I do have both a functioning limbic brain and a conscience that's skeptical as hell of it.  However, I'm clear that what I fundamentally want is the freedom and power to reject toxic environments (physical, social, and professional) and to design a bespoke life suited to my and my loved ones' needs.  Wealth, to me, means being able to breathe, even if my needs require resource investment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven with a more ordinary amount of capital in hand, I'm still serious about nesting as a primary life project.  Home should be a delightful place.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a young child, I wanted to be an \u201cinventor\u201d.  I wanted to create contact lenses that would grant eyesight to the blind, and a dynamic converter that would project a cartoonish force field using energy absorbed from local sound waves.  I've tabled those particular projects, but their spirit lives in me still.  \ud83e\udd7c\ud83e\uddea\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\ud83d\udd27\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel curious about working with something more tangible than pixels and bytes.  Materials science sparks my imagination.  Could I create an eco-friendly material that beats plastic at its own game, at a lower price point?  Something that biodegrades into clean air, let's say?\r\n\r\n\r\nI also feel curious about moving deeper into the business side of the world.  I've been encouraged to contact leading MBA schools and ask whether they'd consider me as a nontraditional applicant.  The idea keeps boomeranging back into my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I can still make something of these dreams without disappearing entirely into the pages of Baby Blues.  If it takes time, it takes time.  It would be lovely to land in the kind of relationship where we can plan across decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI assure you, fam, I am a highly qualified Superloser.\r\nSome art I've made\r\nI took these photographs.  I take a lot of photographs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs any professional photographer will tell you, snapping photos is a perfect example of Superlosing.  You attempt a hundred shots in earnest to capture a single great one, and then you go home proud, with a camera roll full of 99% duds.  This is considered a good ratio.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was sixteen, I collaborated with my best friend to compose a progressive-metal instrumental track.  The piece was stylistically inspired by a band called \u201cAnimals as Leaders\u201d, which you should definitely check out.  We titled our track Amaranthine.\r\n\r\n\r\nI write poems.\r\nIf I like you, I will write you a poem.\r\nBem's androgyny, y'all\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe more I look at that mise-en-place, the more I wonder\r\nwhat she plans to do with the ladle.  Defense, maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\nSandra Bem\u2019s androgyny framework is the actual bee\u2019s knees.  Here\u2019s the rundown:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are culturally tagged \u201cmasculine\u201d and \u201cfeminine\u201d modalities of thought, feeling, and behavior.\r\nA fully developed human has mindfully cultivated both in themself through a combination of deliberate self-work and acquiring varied life experiences.\r\nThat human is the Avatar of shitty gender constructs, bending all the elements at once:\r\ncompetence and warmth, yin and yang, nurturance and agency, assertiveness and receptivity\u2026\r\nAccording to Dr. Bem, they've risen to the rank of \u201candrogynous\u201d, the peak of human potential.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Bem came up with this idea and developed research tools to measure people on a two-axis system of \u201cfemininity\u201d and \u201cmasculinity\u201d, with the really cool people landing in the upper-right quadrant, high on both scales.  Those folks can display \u201csituational appropriateness\u201d across a wide variety of contexts, either by switching modes or by blending both modes at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nBem\u2019s androgyny feels like a cousin to two of my other favorite ideas in philosophy, which are the golden mean (watching out for \u201ctoo much\u201d and \u201ctoo little\u201d in literally all things) and Hegelian dialectics (thesis/antithesis/synthesis).\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, am I masculine?  That\u2019s a very solid \u201cyes-and\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the final minutes of an attempt at a sub-5:30 mile, I prayed to the departed ghost of my Marine grandfather for the strength to endure and exceed my body's limits\u2014and I clocked in at 5:24, shaking, on the verge of heaving, but triumphant.  I'm excellent with technical systems.  I achieved the competitive rank of Onyx in Halo 5.  For projects that really matter (and some that don't), I plan carefully using numbers and spreadsheets.  I lift weights.  The old Teddy Roosevelt quote stirs my heart and lights a fire in me.  I like making my loved one feel safe and protected and provided-for (so long as I'm not over-parentified by my peer).\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also cried unabashedly at the songs in Steven Universe, which I purchased season-by-season in its entirety.  The lyrics of \u201cLove Like You\u201d\u2014if you know, you know.  Visually, I'm obsessed with color.  I want to be aesthetically beautiful and to create beauty around me.  I'm captivated by sensations and will visibly surrender to joy when I look out over the hills, snuggle up under a soft blanket, or take the first bite of a good meal.  As I mentioned earlier, my special interest (other than deck-builders and approximately every subject in nonfiction) is relationships and feelings.  I'm a cat whisperer and absolutely melt for kitties, baby talk and all.  And I want someone to kiss me like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you spend time on the parts of Reddit where this\r\nsort of image gets posted, please send me a message.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could be an appropriate partner for (among other sorts) a cishet AFAB who is herself holistically developed, and honors and craves the same breadth and depth in her male partner.  Historically, most of my partners have been bi+ and neurodivergent, so the gender thing took a back seat to a grounded notion of compatibility and like-mindedness.  In any case, if you like what you see, I would be glad to hear from you.  Just understand that policing my \u201cmasculinity\u201d would be grounds to end the relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this has bearing on family life!\r\nCatch me teaching grit, agency, and excellence to my future kids, hopefully by modeling these myself.\r\nAlso catch me spoiling those kiddos with bottomless emotional attention, attunement, and co-regulation\u2014which I expect to model just as much in my relationship with my spouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nI greatly value some kind of bend toward Bem\u2019s androgyny in others.\r\nIn AMABs, that usually looks like culturally conspicuous EQ and warmth (with their agency and excellence taken for granted by society).\r\nIn AFABs, it usually looks like culturally conspicuous agency and excellence (with their EQ and warmth taken for granted by society).\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCan we please teach this to all preschoolers, regardless of sex?\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more hot take:\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve developed a view that temperament and neurotype really are what gender is cracked up to be.  People empirically differ in their essential, embodied natures\u2014meaning blank slatism is false\u2014but the pink/blue bucket system is a stain on our culture.  Temperament and neurotype show uncountable natural variations, giving rise to \u201cendless forms most beautiful and strange\u201d among individuals.  People are best bucketed by their contextually relevant distinctions (I call them \u201cCoRDs\u201d), which vary completely from one context to the next.  Reproductive sex class is almost never a CoRD, unless we're actually talking about intercourse or family planning!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth about a person\u2019s talents, instincts, and proclivities dwells in that person, and the optimally developed version of that person is bespoke and exists independently of cultural archetypes.  I don't know, nor do I expect ever to know, what traits statistically correlate with reproductive sex class at a population level in a truly culture-fair society.  I do know that if you're dealing with (for example) a young Norah Vincent, who, as an AFAB child in the early 1970's, persisted doggedly in wearing jeans and climbing trees despite every imaginable social pressure to the contrary, then you love and embrace that lil\u2019 lesbian tomboy from the bottom of your heart.  And for goodness's sake, can we please make heroes rather than martyrs of our highly sensitive AMAB children?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat this means for parenting is: I\u2019m going to let my kids show me what their natural talents and interests are, and then I\u2019m going to nurture those without too much editorializing.  (Yes, rooting out bias and subtle influences is a hard problem, but still.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe user selects negative-one genders, and the fortress bursts into flames.\r\nCase study: BayHouseWarming\r\nIn 2021, as I was moving from Seattle back to the Bay Area, I tried founding a group house with 4\u20136 ambitious residents from among my friend group.  I affectionately called this project the Bay House.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy vision was to gather folks who would positively peer-pressure each other to achieve their dreams more proactively, in a warm and nurturing environment where we all enjoyed one another, shared meals, kept up with each other's lives, and did activities together.  (Looking back three years later, I recognize this as a variation of \u201cfamily\u201d, which I now call one of my core values.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI shot for the moon and landed in the treetops: I succeeded in establishing the house with a total of 3 residents, plus a fourth who visited for a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nI took on sole responsibility for furnishing our new nest\u2014everything from budgeting to design to logistics.  When one housemate's parents came to see the place, they pulled me aside and said, \u201cYou put all this together?  This is not some bachelor-pad setup.  This is a grown-up house,\u201d nodding with a raised brow.  That's still one of my favorite compliments I've ever received.\r\n\r\n\r\nI decided to plan and host a housewarming party, hoping to knit together different parts of my friend group and establish the house as a social venue.  Naturally, I named the party \u201cBayHouseWarming\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nI still have the planning sheet in my personal archives:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIs this \u201cmasculine\u201d or \u201cfeminine\u201d?  You tell me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unchecked items got done in time; I just never went back to check the checkboxes.  By then, the list had served its purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also made this document to help track food prep.  It's an early example of what I now call [pun redacted]\u2014my personal survival tool for C.W.N. (cooking while neurodivergent).\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the rest of the story in photos:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe appetizers turned out delicious.\r\n(The cans are all soft drinks, most with low sugar.\r\nI'm a lifelong teetotaler; all my parties are dry.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI make frequent efforts to share my love of hot sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nReady for trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake it double.  (Or sextuple.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nNametags, just as the sheet foretold!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe crew's all here.  The whiteboard mounted over the hearth was lots of fun\u2014\r\nevery time a visitor came over, something new would appear on it.\r\nWe got poems, lewd drawings, people's hopes and dreams, more lewd drawings\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA chessboard is to some of my friends as a paper bag is to cats.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nDuring the chess match, one of the spectators started\r\ndrawing the other guests on paper plates.  I have no\r\nidea where the palette came from.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMain course: vegan chili and cornbread.\r\nI'm a \u201creducetarian\u201d myself, and it's always easier to plan\r\nmeals for large groups by defaulting to a vegan menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt was the kind of dinner you'd want to eat outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is why.  The view from the back deck that evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs intended, the party set the stage for many afternoons of four-square\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\u2026with the good ol' crew\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\u2026plus many evenings of Telestrations\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t\u2026which got pretty wild.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the Telestrations booklet responsible for those reactions.\r\nWilliam (far left above) saw only page 4, then drew page 5, and was VERY pleased with my guess on page 6.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSex and other wonderful things\r\nIs it bad form to talk about sex in a dating doc?\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2026No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2026Maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's settle for a middle ground.  Here are some books I've read attentively:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Magnificent Sex: Lessons from Extraordinary Lovers by Peggy J. Kleinplatz and A. Dana M\u00e9nard\r\n   * (HIGHLY recommend!)\r\n* Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski\r\n* She Comes First by Ian Kerner\r\n* Rethinking Sex by Christine Emba\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll save most of my steamy shares for a later time.  Here's just one for now:\r\nI have a strong track record of creating a reverse orgasm gap in my relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're my sweetie, I will learn all the ways you like to be touched, both in and out of bed.  \ud83d\ude18\r\nI care a lot about this!  In a fully selfish sense, I come alive by making you come alive.  Nothing is better than a partner's joy.\r\nWhy I'm currently available\r\nAt 23, I met and fell in love with a very wonderful human, who is now working on her own dating doc, which will get a ringing endorsement from me.  [UPDATE: Here it is!]\r\nThat relationship continued for seven years.  We lived together for four of those years, and later moved apart.\r\nFinally, we decided that we had irreconcilable differences and it wouldn't make sense for us to marry.\r\nNow our plan is to seek life partnerships with other people, build a strong inter-family clan, and help raise each other's future kids.\r\nThis person is still my best friend.  I love her.  She's family to me.  We're all good.\r\nExpect her to continue playing a role in my life!  If you're freaked out by this, turn back now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nStill here?  Excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe's great fun to hang out with\u2014smart, sensitive, bubbly, hyperverbal, curious, emotionally intelligent, meme-savvy, plays board games, cooks delicious curries & pastas & pizzas & burgers, emits a constant stream of middle-school humor, laughs brightly and often\u2014so if you feel excited to befriend a bonus additional human of this caliber, there could be cooking hangouts and board game nights and chore-swapping in our shared future.\r\nHow I'm searching\r\nUsing dateme.directory, I ran a database query for every F and NB doc worldwide.  (My data cutoff was 2024-04-14.)  Then I carefully read all 130 of them, skipping one.  That part took a total of 10 hours.  I built a spreadsheet as I went, recording my feelings about each doc on a dual 7-point scale\u2014separately measuring the strength of my positive response and the strength of my negative response.  Both scales work like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n7\u2014overwhelmingly present\r\n6\u2014clearly present\r\n5\u2014weakly present\r\n4\u2014ambivalent or unclear\r\n3\u2014weakly absent\r\n2\u2014clearly absent\r\n1\u2014overwhelmingly absent\r\n\r\n\r\nI recorded my data in normalized form so I could write relational queries.\r\nThen I wrote a query to generate a bubble chart visualizing the frequencies of different score pairs:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I look at the size of the 5/6, 6/6, and 7/6 bubbles,\r\na certain Taylor Swift song starts playing in my head.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also wrote a query to grab the data records forming the lower-right portion of the chart (high positive scores, low negative scores) and sort them in a certain way.  That tells me which docs to revisit at length.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom there, intuition takes the wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you get an outreach message from me, know that a lot of forethought and appreciation went into it, and I've been spending lots of quality time with your writing!  \ud83d\ude0a\r\nContact info\r\nIf anything in this doc has inspired you to say hello, pen a spicy response, ask me out on a date, or just be my pal, you're warmly invited to do either of the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Text me at two zero six, two two five, seven zero four two\r\n* Email me at: langhisc at [DELETE THIS] gmail [DELETE THIS] dot com\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you try one method and you don't get a response, please try the other.  As long as this doc is published and visible, I'll try to acknowledge every message I receive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for making it this far!  Have a blessed rest of your existence, dear reader.  \u2728",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate Kerry!\r\nHi, I\u2019m Kerry!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a lighthearted intellectual with dad energy, who likes to be serious and playful all at once. I appreciate thought-provoking conversations, folkways, and every kind of beauty.\r\n\r\nMy current projects:\r\n* Seeking a monogamous marriage to start a family\r\n* DIY upgrading my house and creating a beautiful yard and garden\r\n* Trying to start a blog and generally publish more work\r\n* Doing computational geometry and cloud backend software at a geology startup\r\n* Running a rationalist meetup\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m like:\r\nI\u2019m extroverted and sociable, and I like making new friends and meeting new people. I like dinner parties and hosting events, and I\u2019m constantly moving in and out of little jokey improv bits. My friends and I often get together for silly events and private game shows, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\r\n\r\n\r\nI get really into learning about subjects that catch my fancy. Some current examples include: How do Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics hold up in light of Darwinian evolution? Are there cool garden hacks to let me grow more plants in Colorado? Why do Karl Popper\u2019s fans claim empiricism is wrong? What does societal collapse look like, and are we experiencing one? What will LLM-based agents look like, and how will they act? How is there a whole volume of Robin Hood ballads when I\u2019ve only ever heard the one with the peddler?\r\n\r\n\r\nI really want to have a big family. I understand that in parenting, as in battle, no plan survives contact with the enemy, but I\u2019m low-key thinking that five children sounds good.  I\u2019m open to more, but we are not a good match if you want fewer than three kids. A dog would be nice, too\r\n\r\n\r\nI love making music. I play saxophone in a chiptune band, and occasionally strum murder ballads or Americana songs on my guitar. I used to sing baritone in choirs in and out of school and am thinking about getting back to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to be outdoors and the wilder the better. Hiking and skiing and camping restore me to myself. Delight is U-shaped valleys, geologic strata, and cliff-nestled glacial lakes. Sometimes I will bring a recorder to the mountains and play songs for the forest creatures. I\u2019m a big fan of backyard chilling around a fire pit, and of road tripping to national parks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn between all that, I read many books, drink fancy cocktails, and play games with friends. I also write, though that\u2019s new and should still perhaps be considered aspirational. I\u2019m still figuring out how to (and how much to) rebalance my time away from ephemera (socializing, outdoors, learning, travel, experiences, weak relationships) into more durable things (published work, communities, strong relationships, traditions, a family, and maybe a startup)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpicy stuff:\r\nPolitics:\r\nOnce a progressive, now I\u2019d self-describe as a classical liberal informed by cultural evolution.  Center-right, if you insist on a 1-D coordinate, but I\u2019m not attached to the label. I try (sometimes unsuccessfully) to avoid the culture war; I\u2019d rather focus on living well, controlling the things I can, and connecting to my community.\r\n\r\nReligion:\r\nI spent the last decade as an atheist and was surprised this year to discover that God is real after all. So now I\u2019m figuring out what it means to be a Christian again. I\u2019m looking for someone who is, even if not a believer yourself, then willing to live in a way informed by Christian teaching. I\u2019m still figuring out exactly what this means for me, feeling out denominations, and searching for the right community. I was raised Catholic and always loved the sacraments, the liturgy, and the high-church aesthetics, but there are some doctrinal issues that I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019ll be able to come to terms with.\r\n\r\nSex:\r\nOpen-minded and I like experimenting, but I also don\u2019t need weird stuff to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA relationship with me:\r\n- Monogamous marriage. I want to build a life with one other person, and make decisions as a unit of two.\r\n- Touch is my primary love language. I am very physically affectionate, and I love to receive affection in turn. We shall exchange many kisses and enjoy many cuddles.\r\n- Good communication. I try to be explicit and to over- rather than under-communicate. I am pretty good at picking up on weird emotions or social dynamics in the interest of improving/avoiding them for next time\r\n- I am gender euphoric and I think leaning into gender roles is great. That said, I\u2019ve had to learn a lot of my gender performance explicitly, like an autist. I like being the leader in the subtle leader/follower thing that develops in heterosexual relationships. Ideally, you like being the follower here, and you\u2019re willing to explicitly communicate about this stuff sometimes so we can grow better for each other over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities I like doing together:\r\n- Visiting museums or galleries\r\n- Walking and talking\r\n- Outdoor adventures (hikes, campouts, ski weekends, scenic drives, etc)\r\n- Exploring and refining ideas, or critiquing books/movies\r\n- Hosting and attending barbecues and their winter counterpart, the dinner party\r\n- Traveling to new places/cities/countries\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a woman:\r\n- Someone who loves learning, talking about ideas, and seeking out new ones\r\n- Someone who is kind and fair-minded\r\n- Someone who is family-oriented and ready for kids. IE, excited to be a mother, and intending to make raising a family the major ongoing project of our lives until the kids are grown. Certainly not alone! I intend to be actively involved too. But other things should be sidequests while the kids are at home.\r\n- Someone who wants to live in a Christian-informed way, meaning regular(ish) church attendance, holidays, and taking scripture seriously-but-not-literally. (It\u2019s okay with me if you believe God is literally real, as long as you\u2019re okay with the possibility that I may never quite get there.)\r\n- Someone who is politically tolerant. We don\u2019t have to agree (though it would be nice), but it deeply bothers me when someone I\u2019m close to casually and habitually treats political opponents as being uniformly stupid and/or evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNice-to-have bonuses that definitely aren\u2019t dealbreakers:\r\n- Interest in being a housewife or stay-at-home-mom. I think this is a noble and worthy vocation, and I have the means to make it work.\r\n- Interested in making music together\r\n- Being actively outdoorsy and having a fondness for wilderness\r\n- Being sweet and sassy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think we might be a good match, drop me a line at kerrydatemedoc@gmail.com, and let\u2019s get to know each other! I live in Colorado but work remotely and travel frequently, so I\u2019d like to come visit you if we hit it off. I\u2019m aiming to start a family sooner rather than later, and am somewhat open to relocating for the right person.\r\n________________\r\nHere are some more photos of me. I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d and I had long hair until this year, when I cut it off.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffUpdated 5 July 2024\r\nPics\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(All from 2022-2023)\r\n\r\n\r\nMe\r\nVital stats\r\n* 5\u20199\u201d\r\n* 34\r\n* Oakland, CA\r\n* LinkedIn, Facebook\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019ve been thinking about lately\r\nMaybe this is kind of like having an async conversation with me, and is useful to see whether we vibe?\r\n\r\n\r\nSome things I\u2019ve been thinking about:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. That they made this \"hang out with your friends BB-8 and Chewy\" rather than straight-up cult indoctrination into the Jedi religion is unforgivable\r\n2. \u201cYou miss NaN of the shots you don\u2019t take\u201d. Wait no that\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not 0/0, it\u2019s n/0 \u2013 \u201cYou miss Infinity of the shots you don\u2019t take\u201d. Wait that\u2019s not right either, it\u2019s actually just n/n, AKA 100%, AKA the conventional saying was right all along \ud83d\ude1b\r\n3. How open should I be with various friends in various contexts? Where are the lines between sharing, exploring, over-sharing, holding things back in ways that create fun tension?\r\n4. Well shit, now that we finished the climb, we\u2019re on top of a fin of rock with cliffs on both sides \u2013 how do we get down?\r\n5. AI for epistemics is great and all, but what about AI for coordination and political stability?\r\n6. Quintal voicings on piano! And the \u201charmonic experimentation\u201d sitting down at the piano that led me to \u201cdiscover\u201d them\r\n7. Textbook, you say that isometric mappings are linear, and you show that they preserve sums. But what about scalar multiples?!? How can you just not address that at all?!?\r\nStuff I\u2019m into\r\nOutdoors/exercise\r\nI go backpacking in the Sierras a few times a year \u2013 I\u2019ve recently gotten into hiking up from the east side, going off trail, and wandering around the basins, ~as described in this excellent book.\r\n\r\n\r\nI go climbing in the gym and outside, often sport at Mount Saint Helena and occasionally trad in the Sierras.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love mountain biking when I\u2019m back home in Tucson, but I haven\u2019t bought a bike yet in the Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also enjoy hiking, tennis, soccer, Spikeball, and weightlifting.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn most days I do one of the above.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeditation etc.\r\nI do concentration meditation most days, and I\u2019m in a weekly circling/relatefulness group. I used to go on meditation retreats fairly often but recently I\u2019ve been going on noble silence solo backpacking trips in the Sierras, which have been excellent.\r\nMusic\r\nI play jazz-adjacent piano. I rehearse with my band every week. Here we are playing one of my tunes, and here we are playing my arrangement of one of my favorite pop songs.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also enjoy jamming with friends and singalongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m trying to accomplish in the world\r\nAI is rapidly getting smarter, and I expect it to have a huge impact on the course of world events in the coming years. My main professional goal is to make that impact as positive as possible. I\u2019m pursuing that goal by working at Elicit, a startup that\u2019s building an AI research assistant to do literature review. I hope that AI-assisted research can give everyone access to high quality evidence and reasoning, and help us work together to make wise decisions, agreements, contracts, and policies.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelatedly, I\u2019m an Effective Altruist:\r\n1. I used to work on alleviating global poverty\r\n2. I\u2019m ~vegetarian\r\n3. I\u2019m into some weird subcultural stuff e.g. date-me docs \ud83d\ude1b\r\n\r\n\r\nUs\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a relationship\r\nI\u2019m looking for a very long-term, marriage or marriage-adjacent life partner\r\n\r\n\r\nKids?\r\nIn short: probably but flexible\r\n\r\n\r\nI can imagine living a good and fulfilling life without kids with the right partner; I can also imagine living a good and fulfilling life with kids with the right partner. The latter feels more straightforward and easier to imagine.\r\nMono vs. poly?\r\nIn short: ~mono\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve done both and both have worked for me. I lean towards ~monogamy but with flexibility so it\u2019s not a disaster if after some years we go through a spot of not being attracted to each other. Strict monogamy also OK, poly OK with the right person. I am very non-jealous, FYI\r\nPersonal qualities\r\n1. I\u2019m very loyal, I stick with friends and partners. I try hard to make things work in relationships. I\u2019d like you to be pretty loyal as well. On the flip side I hope we can both stay loyal to ourselves and only move forward with deepening a relationship if it\u2019s the right thing for each of us\r\n2. I\u2019m pretty honest \u2013 I\u2019m ~never actively dishonest, and I\u2019m more on the side of over-honesty and over-sharing than keeping things to myself. I need you to be pretty honest and ~never actively dishonest or deceptive. I\u2019d be quite interested in an excruciatingly open/honest relationship, though I\u2019m also happy with normal levels of openness and honesty\r\n3. Relatedly, I\u2019m quite interested in exploring my and other peoples\u2019 emotions/hearts/souls. I\u2019m in the middle of my journey on this one. 5 years ago I was below average at feeling, understanding, and working with feelings. I think I\u2019m now roughly average, I\u2019d like to be extremely good\r\n4. I\u2019m pretty smart. I know about lots of different domains and I\u2019m also pretty good at figuring stuff out. I\u2019d like you to also be pretty smart\r\n5. I\u2019m extremely high-openness. Probably won\u2019t work unless you\u2019re also fairly high-openness.\r\n6. I think I take in and interact with the world in my own weird, surprising, and beautiful way and I think I bring lots of joy to how I interact with myself, others, and the world. Looking for someone who does the same but in their own way\r\n7. I\u2019m trying to accomplish some stuff in the world. It\u2019s not important to me that you are, exactly, but I tend to get along better with people who are\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out!\r\nAt datebenrachbach@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to just send me a quick ping to take a look at your dating doc/dating profile :)",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHi! If you\u2019re seeing this, odds are you\u2019re a woman who is attracted to men and wants or is open to kids, and filtered according to those criteria on the Date Me Directory of dating docs! And if you did that, you\u2019ve probably noticed- \r\n\r\n\r\n-wow! There\u2019s a lot of people! Large number of people! Lot of profiles to look at! That\u2019s a lot of reading to do! Are you gonna read all that? Maybe not! Maybe you need to make a quick decision about whether to read any further! Let me help you out with some\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\r\n* 30 years old\r\n* heterosexual(ish) man(ish) \r\n* flexible on mono/poly\r\n* 5\u201911\u201d (181cm), 190lb (86kg)\r\n* wants one or more kids\r\n* Rhode Island, USA, willing to travel\r\n* software developer, WFH, most recent salary $115k/year\r\n* atheist, ratsphere\r\n* politically like, weird complicated center-left-lib utopian\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, cool. None of those things are dealbreakers? You want to know more? Cool. Very nice. Here\u2019s another thing that might help you make some decisions:\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE\u2019S WHAT I LOOK LIKE\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hair situation is less than ideal for me, as it impedes a certain wise wrestleman\u2019s sacred commandment that you gotta have blue hair, but unfortunately the family genetics are merciless in that department. C\u2019est la vie. I compensate by wearing blue everything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, one thing that\u2019s important to me is- do you like that? Do you see that and think, \u201coh, hey, that looks good, I am attracted to that, it would make me happy to smooch that\u201d? Because, like, I dated an ace partner for a while and it turns out it does a number on one\u2019s self-esteem to not have your partner think your body is attractive. \r\nIf you do like that body, then- hey, thanks! That means a lot to me. Please continue reading this document, and maybe you will discover that it would be a good idea to interact with that body!\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT DOES THIS GUY MAINLY DO?\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I play a lot of video games.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the fact that I mention this first is a red flag for you, you might wanna move on. I\u2019m not, like, the guy addicted to grinding loot in some MMO, games don\u2019t take over my life- but they are a good chunk of my cultural context. I have a lot to say about them, I grew up with them, they\u2019re a major way I connect with people, and I make them as a hobby. It\u2019s pretty important to me that my partner is someone I can talk to about the things that make me excited, and it\u2019d be ideal if you are also interested in and excited about video games. I would ideally like to be able to make my partner happy by acting the way I normally act!\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, it\u2019s not just video games with me. I have lots of other interests! Maybe too many. I also read webcomics and fanfic and play tabletop games and watch anime, that whole cluster of very-online interests. Sometimes I even watch movies or read books! Wild stuff. When I consume media I like to discuss it to death with people, and if you also like to discuss media to death then we might be a good fit!\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from consuming various sorts of media and working my day job, I\u2026\r\n* Make video games\r\n* Draw things\r\n* Write fiction\r\n* Sort of do all three at once collaboratively (run RPGs)\r\n\r\nYou might notice a theme here wherein these are all just the production of the same things I spend the rest of my time consuming! It\u2019s an endless cycle! Dare you date an ouroboros?\r\n\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s the main thing, isn\u2019t it? Like, what are you in for if you attach your life to mine? Because creating is important to me, and I have limited capacity to compromise on it. The prime directive is to create until nothing is left to create, and the universe bursts with an overworked sigh. The number one thing I\u2019m looking for is someone who can support that, and is happy to support that. If you\u2019re also a creative, and we can feed on each other\u2019s energy and reinforce each other- that\u2019s the dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ABOUT SEX AND RELATIONSHIP STUFF THOUGH\r\n\r\n\r\nOh jeez. Maybe you were curious about the heterosexual \u201cish\u201d in the bio? Thing is, I definitely experience heterosexual attraction strongly, but the sex bits of human bodies seem kinda\u2026 gross? The whole affair seems kinda unsanitary and unappealing. Crucially, though, I haven\u2019t tried it, and I hear it feels great despite how it looks (also you need to do it to have kids), and I\u2019m willing to take that on faith and figure out a way to have fun with it- so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d self-describe as sex-repulsed or asexual. You\u2019re not dealing with a high sex drive but I am pretty much down for whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith monogamy and polyamory- I sort of prefer poly, but not for the standard reasons. On the relationship side of things\u2026 I have clear weaknesses as a partner. I\u2019m bad at consoling and dealing with sadness, I get absorbed in ambitious projects and am jealous of my own time, so\u2026 like, if I\u2019m failing to support you in some way and you can get some backup support from someone else, great! And on the sex side of things, modern contraceptive technology exists and so I don\u2019t really experience jealousy (so long as I\u2019m not stuck raising someone else\u2019s kid). However you need to meet your relationship needs, I\u2019m happy for you. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut, like\u2026 if we really click, and we don\u2019t feel like we need anyone else, our relationship issues are surmountable the old-fashioned way, and you\u2019d prefer monogamy? I have no problem committing to that. Higher bar to clear, I guess? Like you should be really confident I\u2019m capable of being the one guy you\u2019ve got.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT\u2019S ON THE WISHLIST\r\n\r\n\r\nRight, you! I\u2019ve been talking mainly about me because that\u2019s the point of this, and because you are an anonymous reader I currently know nothing about, but here are some traits that I find attractive in a partner! If you have a lot of these and want to ask me out, you have good odds!\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Plays games/reads comics/watches anime/etc- we come from the same planet\r\n   * In particular, likes mysteries, comedy, and weird sci-fi- we come from the same town on the same planet\r\n   * Knows me and empirically likes the things I actually produce- we come from the same neighborhood of the same town on the same planet\r\n   * Thinks I am attractive\r\n   * Is a generally happy person- easy to make smile and laugh (my favorite things to do to people)\r\n   * Has a creative hobby of some sort- art or writing or music, a project to cheer on or help with\r\n   * Looking for a long-term relationship involving marriage and kids\r\n   * Smart in the brain\r\n   * Clear communicator, or familiar with ratsphere communication norms- has read \u201cA Human\u2019s Guide to Words\u201d, ideally\r\n   * I\u2019m not too fussed about appearances but know if you have red hair and/or freckles know that you will be rolling with advantage\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that seems good to you, you can contact me at benedictide@gmail.com!",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffOnna Anya\r\nSeeking Meaningful Connections\r\nThat are Beautifully Complex\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Prologue:  the \u201cWhy\u201d Behind It All\r\nSometimes, I think we forget how awesome we are--just us--on our own--no excuses or regrets in our unadulterated singularity of quasar magnificence. Recently, I have been thinking about life, about how now I am in my thirties, how life definitely has not turned out the way I thought it would, and how, as odd as it sounds, I am so glad it hasn't. \r\nI also have been thinking about how though I would like to meet my person, and be there for them when they wake up in the morning, having them be there to pull me into a hug which makes me not get up at 5:30 AM every morning.  I have been considering how I would like someone to share my life with, able to fall asleep next to them on the taxi ride home from the subway and know they will wake me up when we get there and for that person to have me to be there for them in a similar-yet-different way based on their own individual desires for a partner\u2019s presence in their life.  However, I also realize that if these things do not ever happen and I never meet such a person, I will be alright with that too.\r\nAs a demisexual, if dating has taught me anything in my limited experience, it is that I would rather be alone, than alone in a relationship. I honestly still do not know what I want, because honestly, I feel it is not about wants, but about being there for people and vice versa.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Pre-Covid Me @ Stowe, Vermont, Von Trapp Brewery)\r\nHave I given up on meeting \"The One?\" The answer is no, I have not. I have occasionally wondered if he is lost in a desert riding a camel backwards in the wrong direction for the time it is taking to have him cross my path--or if I am??!! The other thing I have wondered is if he is lost in the Bermuda Triangle playing with magnets, or maybe if he has found his perfect elsewhere--it could happen, and if it did, more power to him.\r\nSometimes, I wonder if somewhere, \"My Person\" is wondering similarly as they mosey through desserts, play with magnets in the Triangle, or consider if I too have met \"my perfect\" elsewhere, (which I have not, though I have met some \"not\u2013so-perfect\" in this journey), but I digress.\r\nBut I have indeed given up on \"finding love\" being seamless, easy, and clear. Love really is a journey as Ruell sings, and sometimes like Malec in Shadowhunters, you have to go to hell and back twice for the ones you love, and even then, there is no guarantee--only hope, and trust in the ones we love and live for and sometimes who we are lucky enough to live with.\r\nSo, despite things not working out sometimes, despite the unplanned for rude grenades and emotional suicide bombers we may meet on a date,  we can wear Mithril armor, like Frodo, and ward off the Ring Wraiths dressed up as ordinary humanoids. Nowadays, I also spend time just living life, riding motorbikes down roads at night to the swaying of lit Lunar New Year lanterns, feeling the cool air and enjoying the moon above me, going to the beach in the morning to see what it is like when the day is waking on the ocean, and being grateful for the present solitude, whether it remains forever, or is changed in a instant.\r\nIf I ever do meet \"The One,\" how will I know it is him? Well, if a man is riding a camel backwards across the beach one morning I may just go up and ask him why it took him so long to cross the Sahara, but in all seriousness, I think it will be in the surety, in the kindness and care, in the quiet considerations, and in the fact that they like almost everything about me and I feel the same way about them--that they are my version of Puen, and I am their non-nagging equivalent of Talay from the Thai series, Vice Versa, and that it is not about if we can imagine the world without one another, but that we can ONLY imagine it with each other--in every universe. Is that cheesy and pie-in-the-sky? Perhaps, but I will wait for good dairy products and pastries until the cows (or camels as the case may be) come home.\r\nSo at the end of the day, I think the thing that matters is to trust our journeys and to realize that home and the road to it may be different than we expect. It may not be a picket fence yard in suburbia or an apartment in Manhattan. Home may end up being a treehouse in the jungle or a mountain villa in the Himalayas. Our home may be us and our partner with our kids, us alone in our comfy hobbit hole, like Bilbo, it could end up being us and our delightful roomies, or us and the kids the universe gave us in ways we never planned. But no matter how the road is or what home looks like, it is our road and our home, and that is what our heart beats through and to.\r\n  \r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nAs an online ESL teacher pursuing a business degree, I enjoy learning and expanding my skills. Quiet introvert (ISFJ) and demisexual/graysexual, I approach life with an analytical and linear mindset and am currently living between Taiwan and Thailand for studies/work.\r\nIn addition, I also dabble in Youtube content creation and podcasting and have 300+ subscribers to one of my channels on Youtube and have had 20,000+ listens to my podcasts.  I also write, having a Medium blog I post to regularly and several books that I have self-published on Amazon. \r\nPreviously, I worked for the Dept. of Education, specializing in escalations, spent some time as a booking agent for actors for comic conventions, and about a decade as a interior design journalist.  During Covid, I started to pursue language learning and discovered in the process I love teaching ESL, so I gradually switched careers.\r\nThough I took a large reduction in income in order to pursue my business degree at half-schedule while simultaneously traveling/living in Asia and teaching full-time, I am fiscally responsible, have no debt, all my college expenses covered through grants and scholarships, and I have enough remaining to provide myself with a comfortable lifestyle. Upon graduation next year, I plan on settling in Taiwan, my income will increase and work hours decrease, which will be a welcome change.  \r\nI'm a laid-back, easy-going person who believes in personal growth and acceptance. I've got a quiet sense of humor and I'm always up for a good laugh, even in tough situations. I'm also empathetic, thoughtful, and aware of how my actions might impact others. I'm not afraid to try new things and love exploring different cultures. \r\nI am really good at being there for others who need help, and will always do whatever I can to help those I care about and even on occasion people I do not know well who I know are having difficulties. In my eyes, life is a gift, and we should use our time on this planet to make a positive difference in the lives of those around us. My personal motto is to be part of the solution, not the problem, and I strive to embody this philosophy in my daily interactions.  I value doing the right thing especially if there is nothing to gain, everything to lose, and no one may ever know, but still doing the right thing\r\nI was raised Christian and also with Jewish traditions, and I celebrate both Christian and Jewish holidays and eat somewhat Kosher, but I do not attend church/synagogue. I also do not care what religious beliefs a partner holds as long as they are considerate of others and do not wish to adjust my own beliefs.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Picture taken August 3, 2024)\r\nHobbies and Interests\r\nI'm a sci-fi nerd with a serious love for Star Trek (Picard, Voyager, and Spock are my jams) and Stargate Atlantis (just tend to skip the pilot). John Shepherd is my spirit animal\u2014I mean, who doesn't love a witty, intergalactic space dad wrangling cranky scientists and adorable aliens?\r\nMy British drama obsession includes Sherlock, Call the Midwife, and Bleak House, especially when Martin Phipps is behind the music or Brendon Coyle is a supporting actor (Larkrise to Candleford or North and South)--his ability to bring depth and authenticity to his roles is unmatched.\r\nWhen it comes to fantasy, Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are my favorites.\r\nFor a good laugh, I can't resist The Big Bang Theory. Sheldon is my comedy hero, and I enjoy films and TV shows that explore self-discovery and living authentically, like The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, which truly is about the quintessence of life. ;)\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Staying chill during the pandemic)\r\nWhen I need to relax, I turn to PG-rated BL Asian dramas, like Bad Buddy and Vice Versa. Demisexual characters, emotional attachments, and no annoying gender wars make these shows a breath of fresh air compared to other genres, with their thought-provoking portrayals of conflict resolution and emotional depth. I particularly relate to the demisexual characters, Pran and Talay, whose journeys I resonate with.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Tamsui Fishermen\u2019s Wharf\u2013December 2022 Walkabout @ one of my favorite places on earth)\r\nI also love taking long walks (1-3 hours), preferably on the beach, near mountains, and sometimes in the rain, and I enjoy e-biking and motor scooters (I often will go for rides to explore different beaches along the coasts or for rides through the rubber tree jungles).  \r\nIn addition, I am learning Thai, Korean, and Mandarin, and I like to travel and explore\u2013as long as tea shop stops are included. \ud83d\ude42\r\n\ud83d\udc40The Fine Print\u2013LOL\ud83d\udc40\r\nBecause of a childhood head injury, I experience intermittent hearing loss in my left ear (neurological deafness) and a limited sense of smell. I also have some gaps in my early childhood memories. As a result, I abstain from alcohol as a precautionary measure. Despite these challenges, I remain intellectually sharp and academically successful (consistently make the Dean's List).\r\nI am 5\u2019 6\u201d (167 cm) tall and tend to be reserved in public, especially with people I don't know well, partly due to my hearing difficulties. However, I become more open and comfortable as I develop trust and familiarity with others.\r\nI have high-functioning autism, which makes me logical and analytical as well as spatially-oriented though I tend to have trouble detecting certain things, such as sarcasm.  I am very curious about things in general, and thought to be younger than I am because of my appearance and inquisitive nature.  Because of the HFA, I do appreciate when people say what they mean rather than being vague, and find that logical arguments sway me far more than emotional ones.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(At Driving School Learning how to drive a scooter in Thailand\u2013got my license in February 2024)\r\nI do not have any remaining family as I lost both my parents by the time I was 30 and my younger sibling during the pandemic.  Though these losses were extremely difficult, I have many friends who have become like family through the years and I have maintained a very positive outlook on life.  \r\nThough uncertain of having bio kids, I've always planned to start a family through adoption, regardless of bio children, envisioning a household with 2-3 children over the next decade-and-a-half.  I want to provide a home for children who otherwise might not have one.  I am also open to surrogacy if biological children are important to a partner and I cannot bear children.\r\nRegarding dating and relationships, I have limited experience as I spent my youth and young adulthood taking care of relatives who were in poor health and helping to raise my younger sibling.  Because of my desire to be fully present for my family and also to not possibly burden a partner, I did not consider dating until I was in my early 30\u2019s.  \r\nAs I've explored the dating world, I've found that some men's preferences and priorities don't always align with my own. Many have expressed a strong desire for biological children while preferring not to be involved in their care. Others have sought casual encounters or wished to marry quickly, while still others weren't interested in living abroad, all of which don't resonate with my personal goals and values.\r\nI deeply respect everyone's right to pursue their own dreams and desires, but I've come to understand the importance of remaining true to myself and my vision for the future, particularly when it comes to building and creating meaningful relationships.\r\nI value independence and self-reliance, and I strive not to inconvenience others. However, I understand that in a healthy relationship, partners should be able to rely on each other. I would need a patient partner who appreciates that, as trust grows, I will be able to depend on them more, even though I am capable of handling many things on my own. This balance of independence and reliance should make a relationship with me easier, rather than harder.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Teacherly-Mode\u2013Summer 2023)\r\nWhat I am Looking For\r\nThe main things I look for in a partner are mutual consideration, care, comradery, and a good sense of humor that is not mean toward others. Another factor for me is that the other party is not intent on changing me in the same way I am not intent on changing them, but that we like one another \"as is\" and that our main joy in a relationship is being present for one another on our journey through life and sharing the good things life brings--like mountain views and boba tea, for example. In essence, someone who shares my drive for personal growth, is willing to explore the world together, and is up for a bit of laughter and fun along the way.\r\nI believe in building a strong foundation of trust, understanding, and friendship before discussing serious commitments such as sex, marriage, or living together romantically. Typically, it takes me 6-12 months to feel comfortable enough to explore these topics. However, I am open to the possibility of living with someone in a more platonic way initially, especially if they are from overseas and looking to relocate closer to me. \r\nI understand that a somewhat-platonic living situation with a partner for several months may seem odd, but with consideration that my partner may be coming from a distance, this situation would help us to spend more time together and grow our connection, while still respecting my need for emotional intimacy to develop at a slower pace.\r\nI prefer a non-smoker as a partner, as I am allergic to both cigarette and marijuana smoke. Additionally, my cat allergy prevents me from having them indoors, though I am open to the idea of an outdoor cat as a pet.\r\nI also have food allergies to spicy foods, pork, and seafood. While I am perfectly fine with my partner eating whatever they like, I understand if these restrictions may be a concern for some. If that is the case, it might be best not to reach out to me.\r\nAs a demisexual, it seems to me, what makes successful relationships work is a combination of extreme care--friendship as well as love + understanding and enjoying the silence as well as the noise with someone.\r\n  \r\n\r\n(Adopting a Serious Face. . .)\r\nMoreover, I am LGBTQI+ friendly and enjoy watching inclusive dramas. It is important for me to be with someone who is accepting of these aspects of my personality and interests. If you are open-minded and comfortable with these preferences, I would be delighted to hear from you.\r\nI am not good at flirting, but thoughtful gestures, surprising someone with their favorite snacks or going to a concert/art show I know they would like are things I would do. Also, suggesting we binge-watch a C-drama on martial arts together as I believe that a strong relationship can handle the commitment of watching a l-o-n-g series and appreciating the shared experience over time would be the closest I get to flirting.\r\nCaveats: \r\nAs mentioned, I have no preference on religious beliefs, ethnicity, or body type, etc. of a partner, but I do ask that anyone who messages me understand I am not changing my beliefs or body type to suit them anymore than I expect them to change their beliefs or body type--we are what we are.  I am currently working to be more healthy and to lose some weight, but this is for personal rather than for partner development.\r\nAs discussed, I live in Asia and though open to moving to a different Asian country than the one I am currently living in, I really do like Taiwan, and I have no plans to move to the USA or Europe or South America, and do not want someone messaging me back under the assumption I will move to these locations if a relationship progresses.\r\nI value a monogamous relationship that prioritizes mutual respect, safety, and open communication. While I understand that everyone has their own preferences, I want to be transparent that I'm not interested in engaging in kinky activities, oral sex, or any sexual activities that may pose a risk to either partner's health and safety.\r\nFurthermore, sharing NSFW content is not something I feel comfortable with, as it does not align with my personal preferences and values. I believe that transparency and clear communication are essential in any relationship, and I want to ensure that potential partners are aware of my boundaries before pursuing a connection, and wish you the best in finding a more compatible partner if you have different relationship goals.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n(Coming back from an adventure. . . Autumn 2024) \r\nAs previously discussed. I'm planning on adopting children in the future, and while I'd be delighted if a partner wanted to co-parent with me, I also want to make it clear that this isn't a requirement or expectation. I'm fully prepared to undertake the adoption process and care for the children on my own, both emotionally and financially.\r\nMy hope is that by sharing this information upfront, potential partners can feel reassured that there's no pressure or obligation for them to take on any financial or legal responsibilities related to my future adopted children. While I'd love to have a partner who is supportive and involved in my family life, I understand and respect if that's not something they feel comfortable with or are ready for.\r\nIn order to address any potential concerns, I'd like to clarify that I have made arrangements to ensure that my family, including any future adopted children, will be cared for in the unlikely event of my passing. While I appreciate the thoughtfulness of a potential partner considering this aspect, I want to emphasize that I do not expect them to take on any legal or caregiving responsibilities for my children in any circumstances.\r\nMy intention in bringing up this topic is not to be blunt or macabre, but rather to provide transparency and alleviate any potential concerns. That said, if my desire to adopt is still an issue for someone, I kindly ask that they refrain from contacting me for a possible relationship, as this is a deeply important part of my life plan.\r\nLastly, I am an even-tempered person, and when I do find myself upset, which is rare, my preferred method of dealing with the situation is to take a step back, calmly identify the specific issues, and communicate them clearly without raising my voice.\r\nWhile I'm open to disagreements and respectful discussions they may bring, one thing that truly bothers me is when someone tries to demand something from me. I believe in respecting others' autonomy and privacy, and I tend to keep my disagreements with people to myself unless directly asked or if they directly affect me, as I feel it's ultimately their business.\r\nWhile I'm generally easy-going and accommodating, one thing that I hold firm to is my autonomy. I've found that some people can be surprised when they encounter resistance from me on this matter, as it may seem out of character. However, I believe that respecting each other's autonomy is crucial in any relationship, and I expect the same consideration that I extend to others.\r\nI understand that not everyone shares this view, and I respect their right to live their lives as they choose. At the same time, I believe that a healthy relationship requires mutual respect, and this includes allowing each other the space and freedom to have our own beliefs and opinions.\r\nThat being said, I'm open to changing my mind when presented with a well-reasoned, non-threatening argument, especially if the other person approaches the discussion with patience, logic, and a respect for my autonomy.\r\nDespite what these caveats may imply, I am a very calm and relaxed person, but also want to save others and myself time and confusion and feel these above caveats do that for both them and for me.\r\nEnding Thoughts and Contact Information:\r\nThanks for reading this far and feel free to email if you want to get in touch concerning a possible relationship or even if you read this far and think we would make good friends.  \r\nRegardless, thanks again for your time and consideration and best of luck on your journeys!\r\nEmail:  rosesoutofthesnow@gmail.com",

Obviously, it\u2019s okay if you have a preference.) \r\n\r\n\r\n* Based in NYC (Currently on sabbatical in Argentina and working on some personal goals.)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Agnostic/Spiritual \r\nSpirituality in the sense of my understanding of the world through what I know from science, experience, reflection, etc. Belief systems are also connected to language.\r\n\r\n* Divorced; no kids\r\nThe divorce was in 2017. The marriage was practical and beneficial to both of us. But we were also in love - so not just a practical arrangement either. \r\n\r\n\r\n   * Don\u2019t smoke (prefer that you don't, or you're trying to quit). Rarely drink (don\u2019t mind if you do).\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I spend my time\r\n\r\n\r\nFor work (as defined in the conventional sense), I do machine learning in tech.\r\n\r\nMy background is actually in applied math, which I love. I enjoy using my quantitative skills at work. But I value things outside of work a lot, in terms of how I interact with and contribute to society.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really value expression in life, whether it\u2019s through the written word or through movement. Some of my interests:\r\n\r\n\r\n   * Dance: It\u2019s been a non-trivial part of my life for at least a decade now. I\u2019ve always been moved by music (although I didn\u2019t have the chance to learn music/dance formally growing up). And being able to express music is what I love the most about dance.\r\n\r\n   * Movement practice like yoga, fitness classes and aerial hoop (this is my latest obsession as of a year ago - I always try to have some things that are hard for me to keep me humble and motivated to grow, and some things where I can feel good about myself).\r\n\r\n   * Written words: I love to read (when I can these days) and write creatively. Within fiction, I love any flavor of existentialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n      * Tennis. Really any racquet sport: ping pong, badminton, pickleball (I gave in)\r\n\r\n      * Cooking: I cook for myself and love what I make for myself more than any restaurant food.\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Travel: I\u2019ve traveled a lot, both solo and with partners. There\u2019s a wide variety of things that interest me: foreign cultures, nature, road trips.\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Volunteering: a bunch of different things from children\u2019s health and education to homelessness and food security. \r\nRelationship stuff\r\nThings I value\r\n(both in others and about myself)\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Empathy: I just want to be around people who care about others. I\u2019m empathetic and it\u2019s so easy for me to care about my partner in long term relationships. It\u2019s nice when we can look out for each other in our own ways and our strengths can be complementary. Two people thinking for both!\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Authenticity/sincerity: I just like being myself and I appreciate people who can just share time with me and maybe we see through each other a bit during the time we interact. It\u2019s what I enjoy in any kind of connection, even non-romantic ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n         * Open-minded: I mean in the sense of questioning your own assumptions about life. I\u2019m curious about the deep stuff in life and am very aware that all of my beliefs are also connected to my personal experience and that a new experience or a new rational argument has the potential to change that belief. I may have a high confidence about some of my beliefs based on what I\u2019ve experienced, but I\u2019m always open to learning a different perspective even it that doesn\u2019t make sense to me at that time.\r\n\r\n         * Communication: I think it really goes both ways. This is the mental model that I want to keep in mind for myself:\r\n            * As a speaker, I try to express my needs trying my best not to hurt my partner.\r\n            * As a listener, I have to be ready to hear the hard stuff without taking it as a judgement about myself.\r\nBoth are hard and I know I\u2019ll fail a lot. But it\u2019s a kindness practice the same way I work on exercising my body. In the end, everything is negotiable.\r\nDating style\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we decide we might be a match, I'd prefer to do a brief video chat or a quick coffee date sooner rather than messaging back and forth. I'm sure you're great, but until I know you, I like to prioritize my little free time for my hobbies and with my real life communities. I\u2019m happy to answer anything specific that\u2019s missing here before we connect further.\r\nRelationship style\r\n            * I prefer monogamy, but as I said about anything within a relationship, this also falls under something that\u2019s negotiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n            * Sex is an important part of the relationship but all the values I think are important for a relationship as a whole are the important aspects here as well: Communicating needs, trying to listen without judgement, etc. GGG as the kids say.\r\n\r\n            * Intimacy: Physical touch, showing affection with touch and spending time together with non-sexual intimacy are also very important to me. I don\u2019t need all of these to be important to you as well, but if it\u2019s difficult for you to express through touch, I\u2019d miss that non-verbal communication.\r\nKids\r\n               * I don\u2019t have any kids yet. \r\n               * I love kids and I\u2019m good with kids. (I have volunteered, and still do, in programs with kids and also with kids/adults on the spectrum.)\r\n               * I\u2019m open to having kids.\r\n               1. If my partner is sure about not wanting kids, it\u2019d be far easier for me to choose that option.\r\n               2. I think planning to have kids is a promise to the life that you decide to bring into the world. I think it\u2019s a responsibility that you decide to take on as a couple very consciously when the relationship is in that place.\r\nHow to reach me?\r\nWrite to me \r\n               * if you think we might be a good match, or\r\n               * if something about my profile resonated with you and you\u2019d like to talk about it even if you don\u2019t think we\u2019re a good match.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail: karthikeyan.rajendran@gmail.com\r\nText: 609 613 2710",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffUpdated November 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nHello everyone!\r\n\r\n\r\nI imagine you are here because you really want to find your person. If you want to check to see if you are physically attracted to me, before you read my essay, scroll past the words and you shall find a lot of recent photos. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo much of what I have realized on this long journey to finding my person, is that perhaps I am not meant to have \u201cmy person\u201d. Maybe this path is not meant for me. I feel more of a sense of peace about this now, versus a year ago, when I was doing a significant amount of grieving regarding being very single and childless, despite my best efforts to create that life for myself. \r\n\r\n\r\nThough I have surrendered to not forcing the river, so to speak, I have not resigned myself to perpetual spinsterhood, though it is actually a great life like this. I am still willing to show myself the best I can, and see if anyone out there resonates. I am learning and growing around how to be even more courageous in the process of doing this, and how to more effectively show you who I am. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth process and the chance I may actually connect with someone who seems to be similar to me, keep me on this platform, despite not having much luck with it, since I joined in March 2024. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2026.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will start by saying depth, authenticity, freedom, detail, precision, and embodiment are very important to me. If they are not important to you, this may be a way we are already mismatched. You may find me kind of off-putting or annoying if you want a one-page sheet that sums up who I am and what I want. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am not ever going to be a one-pager type of woman. \r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would love it if you also related to life in this way. I want to know you seek a level of depth, thoroughness, and integrity in understanding yourself and how to express and embody who you are in the world, to the degree that I do, or more! \r\n\r\n\r\nI am a flawed human, with my own insecurities, just like we all are. I have ways I keep failing at certain goals. I am a work in progress. I am very aware of the work, every day. I have learned to have more fun with it all, in the past several years. I suppose I have been accused of being an over-thinker or a person who is too serious. I do reflect and consider many realities, throughout each day. I can also be very serious. But, I am also a playful, silly, fun person, too. I just don\u2019t tend to immediately come off that way, in certain contexts. My conscientiousness or thoughtfulness can be written off as tedious, when I am just trying to show care and love for others. \r\n\r\n\r\nI do tend to be most playful when I am around people I feel comfortable with. I also tend to shine brightest, when I am working, out in nature, being spontaneous, dancing, enjoying a sensual sexual experience, eating my favorite foods, surfing, doing pole, on adventures, and traveling. I shine the brightest during solo travel, though I want to travel with a partner. I long for this.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a really complex person. I think I could spend a whole lifetime revealing who I am to someone. I put great effort into sharing who I am and want to be seen. I also expect the person wants to know all these parts of me, just the way I want to know all of them. I deeply desire to have the type of relationship where we delight in learning more and more about each other, and rest into a deeper and deeper knowing of the other\u2019s spirit. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou will find in me a deeply loyal and committed partner. Someone who wants to take the time to understand and connect with you. I will always push myself to overcome fear and shame, in order to not hide or protect myself, with you. I just need to see you are a safe person to do this with. I want to be met in this way by another. Let\u2019s create a level of safety with each other that we have never encountered, anywhere, through mutually delving deep within and choosing to be accountable, self-loving, and available to each other, every day. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am also an extremely generous person. I want to give the people I love (friends and partners) everything I can. I am big on making and giving gifts. I am big on doting on people. I love creating an atmosphere of abundance together with people. I want us to be so open and fluid in our generosity with each other, that we love treating one another to things. I want to create that sort of atmosphere, where we treat each other like royalty. I want to have you know how deeply special and valued you are to me, just like I deeply long for being treated this way by you. I don\u2019t remain connected to people anymore, who do not have this same aim in their close relationships. I want you to be my treasure, and I want to be your treasure, too. \r\n\r\n\r\nI would love us to create a life together based around travel and living in a way we choose. I don\u2019t want us to settle in life. I want us to both be clear of what we want, and aim for that. I want us to support each other in developing our individual paths to the highest degree, and to live a fulfilling, authentic life. This may mean doing homeschool for our kids, or living in a very unique way together. This may mean developing an open relationship. This may mean eventually being Poly. This may mean us having periods of time where we are traveling without each other or living separately. I have a lot of flexibility in terms of how we can live our best lives that deeply honor who we are as individuals, all held within the love, trust, safety, and commitment we have with each other. I want a strong enough \u201cWE\u201d, so we can also keep supporting full freedom of the \u201cI\u201d, and vice versa. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am a dreamer, but I am also a pragmatist. Naturally, everything I envision with a life partner, is something I have built towards cultivating with them. As I am already living this way, myself. \r\n\r\n\r\nI realized at a pretty early age that if I didn\u2019t get right with myself, I would not be very happy or successful in the world. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I use every opportunity I can to grow and transform. I have done a ton of work on myself (and continue to do so) in order to be the most free, courageous, accountantable, autonomous and capable human I can be. \r\n\r\n\r\nI live nomadically. I have created a job where I have the freedom and the amount of time to travel and play around the world. I am working on becoming even more free and rich in time and resources. I am working on living my life only doing what I want to do, when I want to do it. It has required a lot of planning and failure, but I am getting there, more and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am also living a life where I am doing the exact work I want to be doing. It feels deeply meaningful, and is very rewarding. So, I get the honor of having my work be a naturally authentic expression of who I am and how I want to be in the world. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have also done a lot of healing work on myself. I have gone to trauma therapy, learned all about and healed a ton of my trauma (still working on it), and I deeply understand my strengths and weaknesses. I have become an exquisite communicator precisely because of all the healing work I have done, and the opportunities I take to practice showing up better as a human, every day. My heart is open, most of the time, and when it is not, I do my best to understand why, to share openly about this, and to overcome my fear and shame. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have created a community of people around the world where we have a supportive relationship, who see me and know me deeply, who are not scared to call me out and help me see my blind spots. I do the same for them! This is exactly how I want it! \r\n\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a larger goal of moving to Italy. I will likely move there in April or May 2025. I do not plan to move back to the US. I am from Hawaii originally, and lived in Colorado and Northern California for a while, before moving to Mexico in 2017. I have been using Mexico as my home base ever since. Soon, Italy will be my home base as I travel around and explore more of this amazing planet. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith or without you, my life will be great. I would prefer to do it with you. I would love to embark on the adventure of life partnership and family, done in a creative and unique way, that preserves and expresses the wildness in us.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you interested? Have you built a life that involves this level of courage, adventure, accountability, authenticity, growth, joy, and creativity? If so, reach out to me. I would love to connect with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out via email: \r\n\r\n\r\napommerenk@gmail.com",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHello stranger from the internet. I\u2019m Divya. \r\n\r\n\r\nQuick facts to get them out of the way: 37 years old, India born & raised, currently Chicago-based, straight, divorced, no kids & not looking to have any of my own, pet parent to 2 cats\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf none of those are a deal-breaker and you\u2019re still here, here\u2019s the stuff i think actually matters:  \r\nFor me, partnership is about companionship not co-dependence. \r\nCooking is a love language and how I show care for those closest to me.  \r\nI flirt in English, sing in Hindi and curse in Punjabi.  \r\nI stay fit with yoga, the gym and love a good night (or day) of dancing.\r\nI love sustainable fashion and am frequently found thrifting.\r\nI cheer for the underdog and am vocal about every version of justice this world deserves. \r\nI love my job as a project manager and am the de-facto event planner in most circles. \r\n I am loud, proud and equal parts vulnerable when I feel comfortable with someone.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy story is unusual but happy, and for the right person will be special for all the reasons it is unconventional. Get in touch with me via email: divs.joy@gmail.com,  if you think that might be you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is how I look \ud83d\ude42",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffWELCOME TO MY DATE DOC!\r\nI made this mostly for fun and to meet new people, but if I happen to meet the right girl, I promise I will work to make you feel loved, appreciated, and happy. After all, isn't that what life is about?\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll try to update this document with any potential changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nStats: \r\nName: Kyron\r\n\r\n\r\nAge: 23\r\n\r\n\r\nEthnicity: Black/African-American\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguages: English (fluent), Spanish (very beginner but I REALLY want to learn)\r\n\r\n\r\nHeight: 5\u20194\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality: Somewhat shy, but Also somewhat confident. Smart, sarcastic, but caring and kind. Introvert.\r\n\r\n\r\nBio:\r\nHi! My name is Kyron! I'm currently in Peoria, Illinois, but my family lives in Chicago. I am also looking for work in Chicago at the moment as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a college graduate with a degree in Game Design (what a useful degree, I know). I have a fair amount of skills/hobbies: drawing, coding, skateboarding, and gaming to name a few.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm generally pretty kind, thoughtful and some consider me funny, but some are probably wrong. I try my hardest to be very caring, but I'm also introverted and can occasionally slow down a bit due to low social battery. Hopefully anyone that would be interested can understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm Looking For:\r\nI'm searching for a 21 - 24yo female (Cis), with an open mind and a kind heart! I'm quite left-leaning politically, so I'd want a girl to be the same, although I'm open to different perspectives, to a point. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am dating with intention, but I also prefer a slower style of relationship building so I can see if things can really work out.\r\n\r\n\r\nLikes: \r\n* Skateboarding, drawing, coding, deep or political talks, cuddling, occasional silence, exploring, fun small dates (boba, coffee, libraries, bookstores, museums), music, video games, manga/anime (trying to get back into these)\r\n\r\n\r\nDislikes: \r\n* Overly loud people (occasionally this is fun, especially for a joke), unrealistic expectations, unclarity of intentions, hyper-aggression, bigotry, overly traditional roles, large parties or clubs\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers (Absolutely Must NOT Have):\r\n* Super religious, sorry.\r\n* Right-leaning, or believe in racism, genocide, sexism, homophobia, Ect.\r\n* Smoker of any kind or Heavy drinker.\r\n* Aggressive, particularly enjoys fighting or arguing.\r\n* Unreasonability/No communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreferences (Nice to have, but not necessary):\r\n* Belief in communication to solve problems.\r\n* College education of some kind\r\n* Ethnicity different to mine (I really like learning about other cultures/people)\r\n* Knowing multiple languages\r\n* Likes cuddling/physical affection\r\n* Thinner-medium body types (No shame to bigger girls!)\r\n* Somewhat athletic\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Plans:\r\nI generally go with the flow of life, but I do aim to work hard at being a software developer, preferably for video games. Things may be uncertain in the near future, but hopefully you will encourage me through it!\r\n\r\n\r\nOther things that may be important to you:\r\n\r\n\r\nI am all about transparency. So I will share some things about me that may be of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I have an ex that I am still good friends with. I don't have any romantic feelings towards them anymore, something broke in me after we broke up and I just couldn't go back.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I do like sex, but I don\u2019t think this should be the basis of a relationship, merely an element of it. That said, if you're into something you feel is embarrassing or strange such as kinks or fetishes, please share it with me! I'm very open in this regard and not judgemental!\r\n\r\n\r\n* I do not like pressuring others into doing things. Please be upfront to me about what you want and what you don't. I want to have a functional and supportive relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Kids. I'm not sure if I want kids just yet\u2026 But\u2026 I am open to the idea. The main issue is that I want to be able to provide for a family. I don't think it's right to bring a kid here, just to have it struggle. Ultimately, if you really want kids, I'll probably give them to you, just don't make this decision carelessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I've stated I'm introverted before. I think I should say that if I happen to randomly check out or dissociate, it's not me ignoring you, but rather I'm probably just a lil tired.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact:\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscord: kyron54 - primary messaging \r\nEmail: bluekeshon79@gmail.com \r\n\r\n\r\nPictures!",

My parents were older when they met, married, and had kids, and in many ways they were more relaxed about parenting. Both of my parents are actively religious (Catholic), and generosity and service were key pillars of my upbringing. I have a large extended family, and I am intentional about remaining connected to my family, and especially being a supportive aunt/cousin/friend to the younger kids. \r\n      * Social \u2013 Being a good friend is very important and I like to interact with friends throughout my day. If I am not going into the office, I will often go to a friend\u2019s apartment to cowork or invite a friend over to cowork from my apartment.\r\n      * Spiritual \u2013 I grew up in a very Catholic household. I still enjoy going to Mass on occasion, though the ritual is more important to me than the spirituality. I appreciate Catholic Social Tradition and am comfortable with people practicing or retaining different cultural religious practices. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tSeptember 2023 \u2013 work group at conference \r\n\tSeptember 2023 \u2013 Sound of Music sing a long at the Hollywood Bowl\r\n\tSeptember 2023 \u2013 Beyonce \r\n\tWhat I\u2019m Looking For\r\n* I want someone who cares about the work he does for the world, and views his job as additive to society, but I don\u2019t want to be with someone who spends all his free time strictly on work. \r\n* I love being with people, and would be skeptical or reluctant to spend a lot of time with someone who does not seem to need or want close friendships. I don\u2019t want to become your sole source of activity and socialization (it\u2019s happened for me in the past). \r\n* Your job should be important to you and provide some level of passion and purpose. If you work all the time to the point that it does not allow you time for activities or friends, or really impacts your mental health, we may not be a good match. \r\n* Lifestyle\r\n   * Weekly activities \u2013 I hope you enjoy meeting up with people and trying new activities!\r\n   * Travel \u2013 are you open to both domestic and international trips?

That being said, I do not want to undergo fertility testing or IVF. I\u2019ve seen too many family members and friends suffer (emotionally and financially) and I know that there are too many kids in need of homes.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffFernando\r\n34\r\nMan\r\nFrom Spain\r\nCurrently living in central Germany\r\nWishing to move somewhere else\r\nLooking for a lifelong monogamous relationship with a woman\r\nI don't want children\r\nTeacher\r\nlazy.romantic.nerd@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nHi! Welcome to my Date Me page. Thank you for your time!\r\n\r\n\r\nME IN A NUTSHELL: Emotionally aware, nerdy romantic with a relaxed attitude to life and work\r\nEmotionally aware\r\nI have been described as \u201ca real nerd, but with a lot of emotional intelligence\u201d. For me, the first step towards emotional maturity is this: I don\u2019t think wishes or preferences can be rationally justified at all. Communicating your wishes to someone means saying \u201chey, it turns out I have this random wish. Who would have guessed? What are your random wishes?\u201d. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can argue rationally that doing A is required/conducive to achieving B. But at the bottom there is an unjustifiable wish to do B, or an unjustifiable wish not to do B. Realizing this was fun for me: \u201cI don\u2019t need any justification for my preferences!\u201d - I thought. \u201cI can simply enjoy them!\u201d. Incidentally: \u201cI don\u2019t need to bullshit anyone again about my preferences, I can simply tell them that I have them\u201d.\r\nConsequently, I never say something like \u201cdoing X is the right/wrong thing to do\u201d, and similarly I don\u2019t waste my time listening to people trying to convince me of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want a relationship in which it is clear from the get-go that we are two people with a thousand random preferences (many of which we aren\u2019t even conscious of) working together to build a common comfort zone in which nothing essential (i.e. nothing each of us (unjustifiably) feels is essential) is left unsatisfied for either partner. This depends on good communication skills, but, to a certain degree, also on a pre-existing compatibility of those preferences. Experiments are always welcome, but I am keen to stress-testing it as fast as possible to avoid wasting time.\r\n\r\n\r\nI see a relationship as an arts and crafts project at which both partners work continuously, a project in which there are always some loose screws that can be adjusted . I like finding verbal formulations that work for both partners. Some of them are pretty common and obvious, e.g. instead of expecting the other to read one\u2019s mind, saying things like \u201cI would like A to happen\u201d and \u201cit looks like you didn\u2019t like B happening, did you?\u201d and \u201cI think you might like C to happen; would you?\u201d. Some are less obvious, and dependent on the particular couple. Despite  \u201cWould you mind doing D?\u201d being the socially accepted polite way of proposing things, in some contexts it gives me the wrong feeling (for instance, that my partner needs my permission to act). So I prefer changing it to something like \u201cI want to do D and I would prefer doing it with you. Are you game?\u201d (or whatever my partner can see herself saying). If we are going to spend 40 years together, we are going to hear those small things thousands of times, so they better be not just \u201cok\u201d, but perfectly attuned to us!\r\nNerdy\r\nI spend most of my time reading and learning about mostly \u201cacademic topics\u201d (I personally have no interest in other things which usually correlate with nerdiness, such as manga/anime, computer games, fan culture, superheroes, fantasy\u2026 But I have no problem if my partner has.).\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the prototypical rationalists, I seem to be congenitally skeptical of beliefs, also those with a pile of good evidence. I can\u2019t force myself to assign probabilities to things. My answer to \u201cWhat is the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow?\u201d is \u201c100% if our model is correct, but who could discard the possibility that a  wizard has been moving the sun for eons and will stop tomorrow?\u201d. I see nerdiness mostly as the skill of having interesting things to say (as in the British show QI), not as the skill of being sure of one\u2019s beliefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a very broad field of interests and find it very difficult to focus on a very narrow thing. I see myself as someone who has a superficial knowledge of many fields and whose main pleasure in life is to have conversations with experts to learn more about each field. This is particularly true of ethnic groups and religions: one of my passions is knowing enough about each country, culture and religion to have an interesting conversation with any of their members. However, I am often disappointed when people know even less than me about their own culture/religion. (I could never understand arrogant nerds. When other don\u2019t know much, I don\u2019t feel superior, I feel bored/sad)\r\nHow is it possible, for instance, that me, a non-believer, knows more about a religion than a person who claims said religion is the key to eternal bliss? A real example from a couple of months ago:\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo women approach me to evangelize me. I ask them where they come from: Nigeria. I ask which of the five main Nigerian ethnic groups I know they belong to: Igbo. I ask them about the Biafra war, about the role of religion in Nigerian politics, about the harrowing Igbo tradition of Isiku: They don\u2019t have much to say about any of those topics. They take me to their pastor. He tells me his church is Pentecostal and Reformed. I ask whether it is traditionally Calvinist, or Arminian. He has never heard of Arminianism (?), and tells me his church is from Ghana, not Armenia. I go home and pray that the Flying Spaghetti Monster has pity on his soul. \r\nList of topics I am currently passionate about\r\nHistory\r\nGeopolitics (though this word sounds today as if I am interested in conspiracy theories; not my case)\r\nLinguistics\r\nClassical Literature in French, Portuguese, German and Persian.\r\nAlmost everything that falls within the \u201cHumanities\u201d\r\nSome Math and Natural Sciences.\r\nIn smaller quantities, also about everything else.\r\nRomantic\r\nI am happy alone, but a life spent maximizing my own happiness feels completely gray. The periods of my life which also included the maximization of the happiness of someone else were full of color, but -alas and alack!- never with someone I could really love. I am looking for crazy, passionate and everlasting love and for that I believe in showing my own craziness to you in a very sincere way, in seeing your own craziness without filters, and in checking if our crazinesses are compatible. I generally fail at pretending to be normal, so lately I simply skip that step.\r\nRelaxed attitude to life and work\r\nBecause of my desire to learn, I value my free time above all, plus I also really dislike stress, so I see paid work only as a means to sustain my life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love teaching, though! I gladly teach things to an audience interested in learning them, and not in getting a grade on a paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nI live a frugal life, not as a \u201csacrifice\u201d, but because I am not interested in most things that cost a lot of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n(The only big expense I can think of is that mid-term I would ideally like to move to different countries in a slow-travel path to discover new cultures. Not a must, though: if a fantastic life with a fantastic partner is tied to a particular place, that\u2019s great too!)\r\nWhat I am looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of the secondary role of work in my life, my partner isn\u2019t meant to just fill the short time between work and falling asleep; making cool things with my partner should be a big part of the coolness of my life. Regarding this I have been described as a \"passion vampire\", meaning I want a partner who is passionate about many things and I want to spend many hours listening to my partner being passionate (thus \"feeding\" from her).\r\n\r\n\r\nI am, myself, full of passion for many things and I am more than willing to let my significant other feed from me. (Not at must, though! If you just won\u2019t shut up all day about the things you\u2019ve read, I will have no other option than marrying you as quickly as possible!)\r\n\r\n\r\nI am mostly thinking of classic academic fields as potential passions, and I tend to be more interested in the Humanities. But an intense enough passion can definitely change my mind!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short: I am looking for an (intellectually) passionate woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs naive as it might sound, it has been my experience that if two (sane, nice) people spend time together, they develop chemistry; if they have a lot of hard conversations from the very beginning, they develop a strong emotional bonding; if they make jokes together, they develop a shared sense of humor, and if they have a lot of sex, they have good sex (especially give the strong emotional bonding). Consequently, I don't see any of these things as criteria to choose a partner. In the nice relationships I had, I was haunted by this question: \"is there anything in this relationship which I couldn't have with any other (sane, nice) partner?\", and the answer was unfortunately always \"no''.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy criterion is that I am looking for a woman to admire. Admiring doesn't require perfection, but it requires a sense of uniqueness. Nothing puts me off more than a person describable in terms which apply to millions of people, e.g. \"I like Harry Potter, the Little Prince, watching Netflix, listening to music, going to restaurants and traveling\". None of these items (not even all of them together) are per se a problem, but an identity based around this is not what I am looking for. I use the toilet everyday, but I won\u2019t try to woo you by saying I am an avid toilet user.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sense of uniqueness comes, in my experience, only from passion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUPLE ACTIVITIES:\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very happy doing my little nerdy projects on my own, but I have realized that doing big-scale nerdy projects (i.e. useless things like learning Sanskrit) alone is very disheartening. Other people find in an academic career the motivation to do this kind of thing, but it doesn\u2019t work for me. So ideally I am looking for a woman who is interested in investing time in our private big-scale nerdy projects. I am quite open to the exact contents of our projects (and, actually, you proposing something would be ideal!), but here is a rough idea of what I have in mind right now (might change in a couple of weeks):\r\n\r\n\r\n-reading a book separately and discussing it\r\n-reading aloud to each other from a book, together in bed\r\n-interpreting \"Romeo and Juliet\" (probably with genders swapped, to make it more interesting), then spending hours reading articles explaining the sexual innuendo\r\n-learning Hittite or Akkadian\r\n-learning prehistoric techniques to build tools from silex\r\n-moving to (insert country: e.g. Mongolia)\r\nMore information about me:\r\n\r\n\r\nI am looking for a partner based mostly on one criterion (intellectual passion), but you might have more of them, so here are some facts about me which might help you in your decision to reject me:\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION: I have lived in several countries and would like to keep changing. Now I have lived in Germany for too long, so I am looking to move out as soon as possible. This means that I am flexible about where you live, but of course if you live nearby it would be great for the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD: I don't have a sense of smell or taste. On most days, I eat Huel powder. I can eat normal food, and I \u201cenjoy\u201d its texture and colors, but I don't want to spend much time cooking (I prefer using that time for other things). But I guess if you are simultaneously a genius and a foodie, I would still love to cook with you while we have amazing conversations. I eat healthy, close to no junk food, close to nothing with a lot of sugar, but don't mind breaking my healthy routine as often as I feel like it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SUBSTANCES: I have no interest and almost no experience with coffee, tobacco, alcohol or any other interesting substance. You smoking next to me would be something I wouldn\u2019t like that much (because I would have to inhale the smoke), but other than that I guess I am OK with you e.g. doing heroin next to me while I read. Going to jail might stop me from reading, though, so we might have to find a workable compromise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECULIAR WIRING: Through the years I realized that I lack several universal human experiences: I don\u2019t have a sense of taste or smell, I can\u2019t imagine things (aphantasia), I don\u2019t really have preferences for my surroundings (or maybe rather: my interior design dream is living in a prison cell), and I have less than average appreciation for aesthetic stimuli (i.e. I really enjoy really good movies, but I don\u2019t want to devote much time to enjoying really good movies).\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil recently I thought I was a weirdo. Not exactly a robot (who wouldn\u2019t enjoy things), but some kind of (less be pretentious!) pure soul trapped in a body, since my main pleasures come from intellectual things like learning and having conversations, and emotional things like having in love and introspecting about whether I have really ever been in love.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut recently I realized that there are some purely sensorial things that I enjoy, so I am trying to find them all. The list is small for now: 1) Barefoot walking. I love it! I have been trying to walk barefoot as much as I can, but given my Spanish acculturation, I can only do it in Summer. This one is a bit of cheating, though, because it also gives me the pleasure of breaking social norms. 2) Hanging from walls. I have recently started doing bouldering, and I liked it from the beginning. But then I did one route in which one starts horizontal and kinda tries to become vertical while climbing. I realized that I love hanging horizontally from walls. If I could, I would install this route at my place so that I could hang every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMOR/SILLINESS: I share with Pierre Desproges the (I would say political) conviction that \u00ab on peut rire de tout, mais pas forc\u00e9ment avec tout le monde \u00bb. I would love it if you are one of those with whom I can laugh about absolutely everything. Also related: I need daily doses of silliness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT\r\nSince this is a game of low numbers, I find it a pity that I only get the positive feedback. I would be eternally grateful if you read till here, didn\u2019t like something, and told me. I\u2019m just curious to know what kind of women read this.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in me in a romantic or friendly way, or even if you just want to tell me that something I said made you smile, I will be more than glad to hear it! I have replied to every message till now, so don\u2019t be shy!\r\n\r\n\r\nlazy.romantic.nerd@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*\r\nMe seen through the wiser eyes of a friend:",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffBlake, 28, feral, looking for a new home\r\nI\u2019m running a two for one deal, this is my cat Gibbs, he goes where I go.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA little bit about me\r\nLife goes between jam packed and absolutely nothing, just the way i like it. I'm usually getting up to something most weekends like hiking, road tripping, or catching my brother's concerts. During the weekdays I like to read in peace, paint, or just chew through a video game. If I'm not planning anything, my friends up in frisco are doing something wild while I visit - ask me about the \u201canything but clothes\u201d party :P\r\n\r\n\r\nTraveling is one of my loves. Last year I spent two weeks in New Orleans and then drove up the coast of Maine to visit Bangor, the city that inspired Stephen King\u2019s IT. Language is one of the things that motivates my travels. I love hearing local slang, mannerisms, and the cadences people have when they interact with me. I was on a Bayou boat in Louisiana once, we were trudging along a gator filled strip of water called the \u201cDead River\u201d and the captain told us we needed to be careful traveling through here because roots will \u201cBunny ear\u201d (dent) the rotor. It\u2019s so small but I love finding words that don\u2019t leave a hundred mile radius.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorror stories are a passion of mine, I love the themes, the visuals, the often goofy nature of it. Who doesn\u2019t love getting a little tingle on their spine every now and again ;) it teaches us how to appreciate the happy stuff. It\u2019s meditative for me, by looking at the fears in my core I can learn a little bit about myself. Why am i scared, how does that bleed into my day to day life, who else feels this way, and of course, how do I turn that into something I can express - giving me a deeper connection to those around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nStories like Berserk have always resonated with me. It\u2019s a manga about trauma, violence, loss, awful shit - but it\u2019s also about healing and how the connections we make help get us through life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCareer\r\nI\u2019m very passionate about my career in art - filmmaking, painting, sculpture, and the occasional bad poetry. Because of this my identity and career are pretty intertwined.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy day job is as a video producer for a film/TV microphone company. I generate the photo/video marketing and even some educational videos about the film audio industry. Been working there for a few years and it\u2019s honestly been wonderful. Directing, editing, gaffing, camera, you name it and I can\u2019t get enough of it. I\u2019m happy to be using the skills i\u2019ve trained so long for, that\u2019s not something every filmmaker in this city gets to say - I'm fortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the quiet hours of the night I work on my second career which is making miniature painting videos. It\u2019s still in its infancy but it recently started integrating brand deals and the future is looking awesome. My goal is to document the journey and all the highs and lows it includes, hopefully people can see it and stay inspired in their own painting journey. I\u2019ve gotten some really touching messages and it seems to be resonating with people :)\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUS, I stare at so many monitors at my job so having another project that\u2019s analog is a good way to unwind but still practice something.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe benefit OR embarrassing part of being a content creator is that you can check out all this stuff before hand\u2026I have heard my voice is quite nice so there's that ;P\r\n\r\n\r\nDating\r\nA serious relationship is the goal! I\u2019m monogamous and only really want to date monogamous. Of course, if you\u2019re hunting for something in particular that I can\u2019t give then i\u2019m open to communication and support! Like, we're at a party and you wanna make out with someone, it's whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been in two long term relationships that left a lot to be desired. In the past i was too passive about what did and did not bother me. Since then i\u2019ve learned stuff doesn\u2019t change unless you vocalize it, so expect good communication from me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all honesty, I want to date someone who has a good relationship with themselves and their goals. Passion for life, communication, and kindness are the most attractive traits in my book.\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting you and hearing about your life!\r\n\r\n\r\nInsta @mr_flannel__",

If you resonate with what you read, let\u2019s chat or meet up! psaniko@gmail.com or @akimbow on Telegram. If you know someone who you think might be a fit, feel free to send them this doc.\r\n  \r\n\r\nBasics\r\nMan, straight\r\nMonogamous\r\n31 years old (1992)\r\nBerlin, flexible\r\nGerman and English\r\n190cm tall  \r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies & Interests\r\nEnergy: I\u2019d consider myself ambivert, i.e. I enjoy meeting new people and doing activities in large groups but also need a lot of down time (which can be with close friends). I had periods where I filled my week with salsa, bachata, acrobatics, HIIT, and scuba - and apnoe diving but also ones where I tinkered with a rocket layout for a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nTouch: I greatly enjoy cuddling and massages (recently did 100h of learning Thai massage and am loving it). Physical touch is my primary love language by a mile.\r\n\r\n\r\nSports: I love being active and pushing my body. The past 7 years I\u2019ve enjoyed Crossfit and olympic weightlifting a lot. With friends I sometimes do AcroYoga or go hiking.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharity: I discovered Effective Altruism 8 years ago and it\u2019s become a big part of my life. Most of my friends consider themselves EAs and I enjoy engaging in big questions about our future. It has shaped my career and worldview and while working in IT and finance I was lucky to be able to donate large parts of my salary to charities and causes I believe in.\r\n\r\n\r\nVeggie: I\u2019ve been vegan for 7 years and while I make occasional veggie exceptions it definitely plays into my dating preferences.\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks: Super into sci-fi and fantasy epics (Brandon Sanderson, Pierce Brown, Andy Weir, etc). I also enjoy non-fiction about history, psychology, economics, and the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nGames: I almost exclusively play co-op games with friends (except Skyrim and Kerbal Space Program). Something about strategizing and adventuring with friends in vast worlds is super satisfying to me.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDating preferences\r\nI\u2019m looking for the classic partner in crime. I\u2019m done with short term dating around and would like to build a long lasting relationship. I want to live out my cheesy, romantic side while at the same time knowing I can rely on my partner in whatever life throws at us.\r\n\r\n\r\nStyle: For me that means a monogamous relationship but I\u2019m not strictly opposed to opening it up if that\u2019s what we both want. \r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: I currently live in Berlin but I\u2019m flexible w.r.t. moving in the future. I\u2019ve lived in Hong Kong and the Bay Area before.\r\n\r\n\r\nKids: I want kids and it\u2019s a deal breaker if you can\u2019t imagine this in your future. I\u2019ve felt ready to be a dad for the past three years. Being a parent to me means sharing the work of childcare equally. I love working but would have no issues being a stay-at-home dad either.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther preferences: non-smoker, kind, curious, witty",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate me: Jacob\r\nHello! Here is a picture of me looking to the left of your screen. Position a bright light there if you want to bring the photo alive.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve put more pics at the bottom. Now for some words  \u2193 \u2193 \u2193\r\n(Did this guy really copy this over from a spreadsheet?)\r\n(This works better viewed landscape on phones)\r\n\r\n\r\nOk cool. Welcome to my document. Welcome to Zombo.com my date me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAge\r\n\t36 (Aug 1988)\r\n\tLocation\r\n\tHastings, UK (this is ~1h20 \u2013 2h from London by direct train)\r\n\tHeight\r\n\t178-179cm, depending what time you measure me. (We\u2019re taller in the mornings.)\r\n\tJob\r\n\tI'm a freelance web analytics consultant. I've been doing this for over five years (funnellmarketing.com).\r\n\tRelationship type\r\n\tMonogamy or monogamish fit me well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've got experience in:\r\n- Long-term (up to 3 years+) monogamous\r\n- Long-term (3 years+) open relationship\r\n- Meaningful but non-exclusive connections with people who live a long way away; swapping visits\r\n- Steady friends with benefits\r\n- Mostly just friends unless we're feeling it\r\n\r\n\r\nI've never been married/engaged or done totally random hookups with someone I\u2019ve barely talked to. I need some sort of connection. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf I really fall for someone, then I lean heavily in a monogamous direction, especially romantically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMyers-Briggs (yes I'm aware this is probably more akin to astrology than science, but some people find it indicative :))\r\n\tINTJ (but this varies owing to its inherently low reliability). \r\n\tBig Five\r\n\tAccording to the scientific gold standard of \"random internet test\", I'm high for Openness to new experience and Agreeableness, and moderately high for Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of these are very mixed, however \u2013 I'm not prone to anxiety, but I do think quite a bit about the consequences of my actions. I take doing what I said seriously, and I\u2019ve owned literally all areas of my work life entirely alone for over 5 years, but I'm more inclined to be a little disorganized. \r\n\r\n\r\nExtraversion here is also covering the fact I am the classic \"best one to one/very small groups, likes time to recharge\" introvert. But at parties/conferences, I actively approach and talk to new people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tInteresting link so even if you don\u2019t like this profile, you get something out of it\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEvery Noise at Once\r\n\tWhat I'm looking for\r\n\tI'd like to find a long-term partner, and that's my main goal and my main priority. I want something I can invest in over the long term.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm also happy with just about any other kind of connection, including new friends. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs I live in Hastings, and most potential people live in London, I'd be happy to swap visits (I love showing Hastings to people) or meet halfway. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tKids\r\n\tGenerally lean towards wanting them. Not a deal breaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThings I like to do\r\n\tI like:\r\n- Learning new things. I find so many things interesting it's hard to delimit it, but recurring themes are \r\ni) how and why do people do what they do? \r\nii) how did things and people come to be the way they are?\r\niii) what will the future look like?\r\n\r\n\r\nI also like taking an interest in things for the sake of it. Architecture, natural history, art, fossils etc etc. It doesn't have to be part of some grand narrative or project to understand the world. If I have a superpower, it\u2019s knowing something about a lot of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome books I\u2019ve liked: Superforecasting, Giovanni\u2019s Room, Science Fictions, Permutation City, The Grapes of Wrath, Being Mortal, The Precipice, Flights, The Book of Trespass, Radical Markets, How Music Works, The Gift of Fear, Deep Work, How Pleasure Works, Moral Tribes, Moral Origins, A Short History of Nearly Everything, Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?, The Routledge Companion to Ethics, Stories of Your Life and Others, The Poetry of Sex, Wild Nights, Shroom, Intuition Pumps & Other Tools for Thinking, Writings on an Ethical Life, Three Men in a Boat\r\n\r\n\r\nSome podcasts I like: Astral Codex Ten, More or Less, Making Sense, Rationally Speaking (RIP), The Happiness Lab\r\n\r\n\r\n(Listing any of these does not imply a particular level of concordance with the conclusions of their authors/hosts.)\r\n\r\n\r\n- Hiking & wild camping. Every year I do one 1 week+ walk and I'll do numerous shorter self-guided walks with maps. I've got a knack for finding secret or little-visited places, even in the south-east of England. My longest so far was walking from Kosovo -> Montenegro -> Albania and back; I have a two week traverse of some islands in the Arctic Circle planned for 2024 [edit: done this! It was beautiful. And boggy], and another traverse of a mountain range in Spain. I take a lot of care to tailor what I do to my company, so don\u2019t fear if these sound intense. I can be very happy doing a shorter amble through the countryside.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Friends and family. This is one of the best things about my life. I\u2019ve developed a higher-than-average number of close friendships that I work actively to maintain, and I\u2019ve developed new close friendships right into my 30s. I have an exceptionally good & close relationship with my immediate family. My closest friends are all highly agreeable, intelligent and curious people.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Running. Trying to get my half-marathon time down. It\u2019s useful. You never know when you might need to run 20k to catch a bus.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Gigs and live music. I see a bunch of local/UK bands as well occasionally seeing something truly international. My taste is super broad but rock, metal, and folk would be my core genres.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Cooking. I make food from plants; I\u2019ve been mostly vegan for 6+ years. I have like 100+ ingredients, I enjoy trying things that take work to get the ingredients/recipes for (I\u2019ve translated a few). I like novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Learning French. I got my B1 certificate ages ago, currently in the push to get to B2 and I want to pass the exam by the end of 2025. I\u2019m currently making every francophone I meet speak to me in French. So I\u2019ve got about 35% more misunderstandings happening in my life than usual right now, sacr\u00e9 bleu !\r\n\r\n\r\n- Learning more about myself. I\u2019m an analyst by trade. I collect data about myself every day, I journal, I try to improve and figure out my personal operating manual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tEA and rationalism\r\n\tI've got a decent background in both worlds. I\u2019ve read a bunch of the core books, blogs and communities. I've been to multiple conferences and have a few friends in the space. My involvement peaked between 2015-2018 when I ran my local EA city group.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think \"EA adjacent\" best covers where I am now. I appreciate it a lot if people are interested in some of the core things that motivate these movements, even if they're not directly involved in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if EA/rationalist framings are your exclusive way of really encountering and thinking through things, I may not be what you're looking for. I am more fox than hedgehog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAbout you\r\n\tI find all of the following really attractive:\r\n- Curiosity. I mean a real ranging curiosity. The kind that stops you in your tracks, literally or figuratively. A sense that you really do just have to know more.\r\n- Independence. You have your own projects going on. You like to do your own things.\r\n- Playfulness. Silliness. The older I get the more value I put on this.\r\n- Rigour (when needed). Following a line of argument is really hot?\r\n- Intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm looking for someone roughly between 26-42, although I'd consider people outside of this if it really made sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHow to get in touch/ask questions etc\r\n\tDrop me a message! jacobREMOVETHISANTISPAMTEXTarthurfunnell@gmail.com\r\n\tMore pictures!  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd shameless pic with a dog:",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHi! \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m Taren.\r\n  \r\n\r\nMaybe you should date me?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n42-year old straight-ish woman with kids, based in San Francisco, looking for a partner to build a fantastic life together.\r\nOur love story\r\nI envision our life filled with outdoor adventures, game nights with friends, and hours of conversation about anything from AI policy to the game theory of parenting to which Game of Thrones character we each are. We\u2019ll celebrate when my climate fiction novel comes out, when you get your dream job, and when the kids win their Lego robotics competitions. We\u2019ll learn and grow together and face hard times as a team. And through it all, we\u2019ll feel secure in each other's support -- a rock-solid foundation from which to live our values and make (not find!) our happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this resonates, read on \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\n\r\nDemographics\r\n\r\n\r\n* Age: 42 (looking for someone +/-8-ish years)\r\n* Gender: Female\r\n* Location: I\u2019m pretty tied to living in San Francisco at least half-time for the next ~14 years, til my kids are adults. Could live anywhere within ~3 hours the other half of the time.\r\n* Sexuality: For the purposes of this document, I\u2019m looking for a partner who is a cis or trans man, or is nonbinary with masculine-leaning energy. Hence, \u201cstraight-ish\u201d in the summary above, although I (also?) identify as queer. Sexuality is complicated! Happy to discuss more as we\u2019re getting to know each other! \ud83d\ude42\r\n* Monogamy? Am flexible on this (open to both monogamy and ethical non-monogamy). More details in the \u201cAbout Us\u201d section below.\r\n* Current Kids:\r\n   * I have 50% custody of my two children: Tuck, 6 years old, and Astra, 4 years old. We live in Potrero Hill.\r\n   * More than fine if you have kids too!\r\n  Taking the kids to see the elephant seals at A\u00f1o Nuevo (2022)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Future Kids: I have a good store of frozen eggs, and would consider having another kid if the right partner came along in the next few years.\r\nMore about me\r\n\r\n\r\n* I've spent my career largely in progressive activism, fighting on urgent issues like climate change. I\u2019ve also spent a lot of time in effective altruist circles. Now I\u2019m working to try to leverage generative AI to increase the impact of nonprofits and mission-driven for-profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBack when I was running the corporate accountability nonprofit I founded (and had long hair!) (2015)\r\n\r\n\r\n* I\u2019m a big ol\u2019 nerd. I\u2019ll solve that math puzzle or go down that Wikipedia rabbit hole with you \u2013 and if we\u2019re not careful, I\u2019ll start a book club or something in the process \ud83d\ude05\r\n* I\u2019m very active, and community is central to my life. I organize writers retreats and hikes, play in pickleball tournaments, host games nights, you name it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy to help you get hooked on pickleball, too!\r\n\r\n\r\n* My coparent and I intentionally designed a platonic coparenting arrangement from the start; we\u2019ve always had separate households, never were married or anything. I am currently in a secondary poly relationship, but finding a life partner is my priority \u2013 I\u2019m open to anything on the monogamy-polyamory spectrum.\r\nWhat next?\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail me at datetaren@gmail.com if you\u2019re interested! If you don\u2019t think you\u2019re the right fit for me, but you have an idea of someone else who might be, I\u2019d love for you to pass this profile along to them!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much for reading,\r\nTaren\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.

I\u2019d love a partner with whom to form a true partnership where we help each other and make each other\u2019s lives more exciting, seamless, and impactful.\r\nIt\u2019s almost embarrassing to mention this, but I probably won\u2019t marry you if you aren\u2019t Jewish.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren:\r\nI want to have a lot of children.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDear Potential Partner,\r\nWelcome to the \"Date Me Document\" tailored just for you! My name is Ian Duncan, and I'm thrilled at the prospect of getting to know you better. Let's dive into what makes our potential connection special:\r\nAbout Me:\r\nI'm a 33-year-old, down-to-earth guy residing in the vibrant city of Tulsa, Oklahoma. By day, I delve into the complexities of the insurance industry, but my true passion lies in running a small media agency specializing in aerial photography and videography.  \r\nInterests and Hobbies:\r\nI'm a man of diverse interests and passions. From the thrill of board games and video games to the serenity of hiking and camping in the great outdoors, I relish every opportunity to stay active and connect with nature. I'm also an avid traveler, fascinated by new languages, cultures, and the intricacies of meteorology. Exploring new restaurants, whipping up Indian delicacies in the kitchen, and savoring a cup of coffee are among my favorite pastimes.\r\n  \r\n\r\nPersonality Traits:\r\nKnown for my quick wit and terrible dad jokes, I bring a dose of humor and creativity to every interaction. As a kind and fun-loving individual, I value genuine connections and cherish moments of laughter and joy. Sarcasm is my second language, so finding someone who can keep up with banter and witty repartee is key.\r\nWhat I'm Looking For:\r\nIn a potential partner, I seek someone who shares my zest for life and adventure. An independent and caring individual who can engage in meaningful conversations and appreciate the nuances of sarcasm and humor would be a perfect match. Cultural understanding is paramount to me, so someone who has lived abroad and possesses a global perspective would truly resonate with my values. I have traditionally dated and been in relationships with men who were not born in the United States, but that is by no means a requirement! Ideally, my future partner is around my age (28-35), takes care of themselves physically, is curious about the world and is looking for their \u2018partner in crime.\u2019\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\r\nWhile physical attraction is important, it's the compatibility of personalities and shared values that truly form the foundation of a lasting relationship. If you're someone who embodies these qualities and is ready for a journey filled with laughter, exploration, and genuine connection, then I believe we could create something truly special together. Please feel free to send an e-mail describing yourself along with a couple of pictures to datethetulsaguy@gmail.com.\r\nI look forward to the possibility of discovering a meaningful connection with you. \r\nWarm regards,\r\nIan",

Am I willing to move down the line?: Heck yeah! :)\r\nRelationship Type: Polyamorous\r\nLooking for: Women\r\nKids: Love the little munchkins, still on the fence!\r\nReligion: Atheist!\r\nKink Curious?: (yeah :P)\r\nCommunities: Effective Altruism, let\u2019s go! :D\r\nAbout Me:\r\n\r\n\r\nSchool\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a junior studying Philosophy with a certificate of Finance, a very active member of my college\u2019s swing dance club, and a new recruit to its Effective Altruism Club! I was also an EMT and dispatcher for four years!\r\n\r\n\r\nI decided to declare Philosophy as my major after taking Ethics and being lucky enough to have a wonderful professor, who engaged me in dialogue after dialogue and helped me as I did my very best to metabolize the material we were learning into trying to understand meta ethics. Super fortunate to have met him - and I'm lucky enough to be taking a class with him again right now, nooice!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSwing!! \r\n\r\n\r\nI LOVE swing and dancing in general, it's amazing that we have such a diverse and strong dance culture at my college! I'd love to share a couple of my dances with you if you're interested! :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis one is super cute, it's from a couple of years ago when I started teaching lessons. The goofball with the pink wristbands is me :P\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd my partner for this dance went from a second semester lessons student to lessons teacher with me for the past two years! Lessons is definitely her baby though, I love her enthusiasm! We're good friends now, much to her chagrin (we consider ourselves work wives who are only staying together for the kids) xD\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1BmMvRnNJqafDCBFvMiB4eOML4Us7YVBT/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\nThis one is my choreographer debut! \r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as they announced Jack and Jills were happening, in my excitement I choreographed the entire thing within 24 hours. It then got improved tenfold by my friend (who was LITERALLY a professional ballerina before college but then decided to study NEUROSCIENCE, amazing!!) who made it so much cooler because she recommended that rather than doing three angels (the final aerial) we instead build up to it with a tower of doom then a tower of doom with split and THEN angel for the big one! Wicked smaht!\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/YGISRgNljIg?si=xR5f0bXL551H4VPS&t=193\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this one, ooo this one is good! \r\n\r\n\r\nMost of us were new to the club, as the club was rebuilding after COVID and so there was a competitive fervor amongst many couples who wanted to take home the gold and showcase their progress to the best of their ability! My friend and I were no exception to this drive, though we did go into it with a mindset that hey, we may crash and burn on stage and if so no worries, we'll continue practicing and record one for ourselves. Fortunately though, I don't think we crashed and burned at all! It's making me happy just thinking about it, take it away Happy Feet! :P\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/DZ6Xcybp8MA?si=PnCYkuZR_P_uxNJz&t=672\r\n\r\n\r\nI gotta hold myself back from sharing all my dances with you, THEY'RE SO FUN! I love dance! \r\n\r\n\r\n(Oh yeah I was Shrek for the big performance a couple of years ago too xD: https://youtu.be/mLLwT3UA4xQ?feature=shared)\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nEffective Altruism!\r\n\r\n\r\nI recently read a book called 80,000 Hours in which they go okay, we got about 80,000 hours in our careers, so how can we design our career to maximize the amount of social good we can provide the world? EA as a movement is super interesting to me and scratches all the right parts of my brain. It's all about empirically being ethical! So for example, which charities should we donate to (it turns out some charities are literally HUNDREDS of times more impactful than others!), why we should be concerned about existential threats and the well being of future generations, and how we can use our careers to make the most impact.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm excited to find out what my future is going to be! I know whichever shape it takes I'll be designing it with the goal of doing the most good I can. I'm going to be working with the EA club and applying what I learned from 80,000 Hours to experiment and discover and deduce what I'd be good at and enjoy. I think if it's possible I'd LOVE to make a living persuading as many people as possible to join EA and to persuade as many people in EA to give more and more to the good fight!\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's because I'm only one person, so I'll only ever be able to contribute so many valuable hours or make so much money to donate. But if I can persuade others? Then I could be responsible for a portion of their contributions and I can scale and scale and scale my contribution to helping make the world a better place second hand!\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nPlus, if I'm going to be persuasive the best way to do that I think is to establish a strong ethos, and to do that I gotta cultivate as much virtue as possible. So I'm talking reading up and internalizing as much social justice theory as I can! From feminism to anti racism to LGBTQIA+ advocacy, the more the merrier! I love reading and learning about systemic problems and how we can topple the problems that plague the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm currently reading the book The Case for Rage and talking to my professor (the same one that got me into Philosophy!) about it. We have a disagreement as to its utility, which I love, because it gives us an opportunity to think deeper about the topic. Plus dialogues I think are fun in themselves! I am a philosophy student after all! :P\r\n\r\n\r\nEMS!\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a senior in high school I spent three days a week going to EMT school, graduated high school, then got hired by my city! I went through the academy, which was super fun - and stressful! xD Charlie squad forever! I worked on the ambulance responding to emergencies for a couple of years all throughout the city and trying out different shifts, and then I went up to dispatch where I was like a fish taking to water.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nI LOVED dispatching! Answering 911 calls, giving folks medical advice over the phone, hanging out with the fleet and solving the ever changing puzzle of unit availability and response time optimization, plus getting to hang out in an office with a whole team of people. I ended up leaving EMS after about four years so I could go to college and start my adventure there! I loved EMS, and I go back and visit every year and bring pizza to the dispatch gang. It's always good seeing them, especially my buddy who\u2019s now a supervisor! I like to think I earned my nickname \"Bubbles\" and wore it with pride :P\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies!\r\n\r\n\r\nDance of course! \r\nI spend let's see... at least 13.5 hours a week dancing. I wish it was double that, but I'm grateful that I discovered this new passion and have had the privilege of making so many friends and happy memories!\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard games! \r\nThere's a really great board game cafe near my college. I love going there and spending an evening playing games, trying to deploy good strategies, being competitive or cooperative, and figuring out the puzzle. Also chess specifically, though I haven't played in a little bit. I usually go through phases with chess where I'll play a lot and then none at all. I exclusively use the hippo opening for chess because I love the symmetry and defensive nature of the system. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe hippo:\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, a hippo:\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\nxD\r\nPrius chats!\r\nOne of my favorite things to do is definitely to spend a few hours in my little Prius Compact with a friend discussing anything and everything! \r\n\r\n\r\nI love developing my friendships and strengthening my bonds with others, plus, I like to do my best to actively listen and learn as much as I can about and from my friends. It's just a really nice ambience. I pull up next to their place so the chat can end anytime, put on classical music, comfortable temperature, we get to sit side by side facing the world together, and have the luxury of being able to switch up the activity at any time such as going and grabbing some food. This I mostly do with who is probably my closest friend, every Sunday after we hit up a local country bar for some line dancing.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also like parties, oh speaking of which at my friend's cocktail parties sometimes the upstairs neighbors will be there with their daughter and I always chase her around the apartment as she tries to get away or sneak up on me and I go \"rah!\" xD I love kids and dogs and all animals and well, people, I love a lot of things! Lol\r\n\r\n\r\nOoo and horror movies! >:) \r\n\r\n\r\nHereditary is a personal favorite!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd editing audio! I made this metal medley using Mick Gordon's music from the game DOOM:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1L4pTOp6NMtm495q0rfhouD4muWAJK0e2/view?usp=sharing\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI love all kinds of music from metal to jazz to kpop to rap!\r\nAlright I think that'll do for a first impression xD \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much for reading this little intro!\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout You:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is where you come in! :D \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHit me up with your own little google doc or email, (bonus points for GIFs and Pics :P) I\u2019d love to learn about you and see your energy! \r\n\r\n\r\nAre we kindred spirits, balancing opposites?

    ProfileText: "\ufeffBit cautious about identification/digital footprint, but I am happy to send pictures and identifying details via email (dmdgeorge24@gmail.com) if you write a few words about yourself!\r\nHi, I\u2019m George and I\u2019m currently a mathematics PhD student in the UK. I\u2019m a 22 years old man and have a sexuality that is a small perturbation from heterosexual. Mostly I am interested in women, and I would be looking for a monogamous relationship.\r\nInterests\r\nMy foremost passion outside of mathematics is the exploration of consciousness using psychedelics. Psychedelics have been a part of my life since I was 19 and have played an absolutely inextricable part of my transition into adulthood \u2013 they have helped me become more confident in my own skin, surrender some of my scepticism, develop a more robust theory of mind, analyse some long-standing life problems that were somewhat repressed, among other things. I have had very positive experiences with people who share an interest in psychedelics and I am currently involved in organising the psychedelic society at my university, so I wanted to note this first. Please, if you have had positive experience with psychedelics, feel free to get in touch!\r\nA potential partner should be at minimum comfortable with me doing psychedelics occasionally and be non-judgemental on the topic. They are of course free to hold whatever opinions they like on drugs or their legal status. Ideally, I would be able to share psychedelic experiences with a partner as a way of dissolving all social barriers/masks and experiencing pure connection between the deepest levels of our consciousnesses. This is somewhat of a fantasy of mine, and does not have to be realised! On the topic of drugs, I have no strong opinions on non-prescription drug use provided it is sensible, responsible, controlled, and does not interfere with your (and by extension my) life in any serious way.\r\nLess intellectually \u2013 my previous interests have included lost media, urban exploration videos (particularly abandoned theme parks), various documentaries/docusoaps, video game history, etc.\r\nPoints about me\r\n\u00b7        6ft0, beard, long hair. Underweight. Good hygiene.  \r\n\u00b7        Unlikely to be considered a normal person in any sense of the word. I have been working to embrace this fact.\r\n\u00b7        I try to throw myself into every social situation I can, and I\u2019m not afraid to branch out into unfamiliar territory or try something new if the opportunity presents itself.\r\n\u00b7        I\u2019m not quiet really, but I\u2019m a bit socially awkward. I sometimes struggle to start conversation but I have got used to carrying on conversation with practice. I struggle to read non-verbal communication (though I do try quite hard) so I prefer things to be verbal where possible. Very physically awkward and take a moment to get attuned to social situations.\r\n\u00b7        Often misunderstand speech entertainingly or take things literally. On the flipside I feel I am quite good at making quips.\r\n\u00b7        I am not religious, and this is unlikely to change. That said, I\u2019m open to dating someone with religious/spiritual beliefs or beliefs like astrology provided they don\u2019t introduce irreconcilable differences into the relationship.\r\n\u00b7        Big on physical intimacy and random hugs/cuddles.\r\n\u00b7        Want a good texter who can match my wall-of-text energy.\r\nWhat I am looking for\r\nWoman (or maybe fem NB - do still get in touch) between the age of 20 and about 30. Some flexibility on the upper end, (and I would perhaps date someone who is 19 and soon turning 20) but I am very conscious that we are likely to be in different stages of life. I\u2019m looking for someone who lives in the UK or somewhere where there is prospect that we may move closer should the relationship get serious \u2013 mainland Europe would be ok for this. I would be interested in having kids in the future, though not until I have a stable career and/or I\u2019m in my late 20s or early 30s. I would ideally like a long-term relationship, but I will definitely not insist this as an expectation on any dynamic that develops.\r\nBasically what I am looking for is a \u201ckindred spirit\u201d, someone who gets me and someone who I get on a very fundamental level. High level of emotional mutual intelligibility. Someone who I can feel completely at ease around, and someone who I would trust with (almost) anything. I am not too concerned about superficial differences, e.g. minor ideological differences or disagreement. Common interests, sense of humour, taste in media is certainly a plus, but has proven to be far from a requirement.\r\nI have a very strong requirement of clear communication. I want to be very clear with a partner when they have upset me, and I want them to do the same in return. I prefer for people to lay things out on the table as they are, and we can deal with them, rather than tension building over something the other partner may not have noticed. We need to be able to freely communicate our needs without any fear of upset. I prefer bluntness rather than having my feelings coddled.\r\nAmbition and intellectual curiosity is important to me. It can be about anything, and it definitely doesn\u2019t have to be something which is her job or is \u201ceconomically productive\u201d. I love hearing about people\u2019s interests, no matter how far they fall from my own (though I may not be able to ask very interesting questions!), and unique aspects of their life experience. If you can talk at length about this, then that\u2019s a major plus. I love when people are unapologetically non-conforming.\r\nI have no real preference on physical appearance. For me attraction is a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, and I think most people are a \u201cyes\u201d. I met my first partner having never seen a clear picture of their face before \u2013 it may be difficult to believe but personality is the only real factor to me. A hard requirement is that a partner should have mental health that is being managed (I\u2019m happy to support, but I don\u2019t think I would be equipped to deal with someone currently in crisis) and should be looking after themselves.\r\nBDSM\r\nMy relationships so far have all involved elements of BDSM. There is always an egalitarian underpinning, I would think of the D/S aspect as more of a \u201cshared performance\u201d that can enter our interactions but ultimately does not determine what roles we take within the relationship. I am a switch, and whether I assume the D or S role is a function of how I get along with someone and the vanilla dynamic that develops between us. As both a D and S, I like strict regimentation, with well-defined punishment or reward systems and thorough negotiation.\r\nI will say that this has just happened to be the case in all of my relationships thus far (I have always assumed the D role due to circumstance), BDSM does not have to be involved in any relationship of mine.\r\nContact\r\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, congratulations. Fire me an email on dmdgeorge24@gmail.com if you are interested or just want to chat. My main channel of communication is Discord, but I\u2019m happy to use Whatsapp, Messenger, Signal etc.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeff(Last updated: 14 February 2025)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Reading guide: Click/tap on yellow words like these[a] if you don't see a right sidebar. I'm using gdoc comments to annotate with footnotes.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHello, and welcome to a time before Tinder and Match.com, where people got to know each other through a more in-depth process than one sentence, a bathroom selfie, and a pick-up line. Please allow me to introduce myself[b], and explain in excessive detail why you should date me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start, let\u2019s get the boilerplate character sheet information out of the way. My name\u2019s Richard Nicholson, I\u2019m a Level 3 Human Programmer, male, age 30, straight and monogamous[c], wants kids (eventually). I live in Pacifica (tiny town just south of San Francisco) and I\u2019m very used to hour-long drives[d] to get anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThis is my family knot, the C\u00e6r Ni\u0263ol!\r\n.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, who is this asshole anyways?\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a creature of stories and games, but I mean both such concepts in frustratingly broad ways which become hard to express through sheer virtue of their vast scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nStories can mean obvious things like books, movies, anime, roleplaying games, and so forth, but it also means hearing about what happened to you at work today, or recounting that one time on vacation, listening to what you liked about a book (the story *of* the story is its own story), or the history of the evolution of ride ticketing models at Disneyland.\r\n\r\n\r\nGames means all the obvious things like videogames, boardgames, roleplaying games, sports, and such, but it also means things like using clever wording to layer meaning into sentences, mutilating the spirit of a rule while sticking to the letter, stepping between all the cracks on the sidewalk, or answering the question of WW1 tanks versus hippos[f] by doing research on how much force they can each exert and survive. I love exploring ideas and taking them apart; I love presenting my twisted results to others and seeing what they do with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a huge dabbler. At any given time I\u2019m doing 3-5 \u201cprojects\u201d (if you can count reading a book series as a project) with a dozen others on the back burner half or wholly forgotten. Not counting regularly scheduled events like watch parties, hobby club meetings, and roleplaying sessions. I try to pack a lot of fun and variety into my life. Accordingly, my hobbies are a pretty good lens through which to understand me. Here\u2019s a smattering of my favorites:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Videogames (action, platforming, strategy, coop/team, logistics)\r\n* Rock climbing[g] (it\u2019s like a workout, but a puzzle game!)\r\n* Books (fantasy/sci-fi, Lois McMaster Bujold, Brandon Sanderson, the Kingkiller Chronicles, and Phillip K. Dick especially)\r\n* Convoluted philosophically-inclined bullshit (Umineko, K6BD, Homestuck, Evangelion)\r\n* Sports (disc golf, minigolf, bowling, archery, curling, and wait there\u2019s more!)\r\n* Sharing experiences and passing thoughts (I love the intimacy of seeing your interests and encounters in real time. I love to share things I find.)\r\n* Roleplaying games (various TTRPGs, e.g. D&D or Tenra Bansho Zero)\r\n* Cuddling (just being together is nice, but touching is special and important)\r\n* Board games (eurogame point salads, worker placement, action point limited, deckbuilder)\r\n* Animals! Let\u2019s go to the zoo or go on a hike and look at birds![h]\r\n* Anime (Thunderbolt Fantasy, Violet Evergarden, FMA, Durarara)\r\n* Writing and game design (I make my own stories and games, too!)\r\n* kdrama (intrigue and mystery) (also does anyone know how to capitalize \u201cK-Drama\u201d and make it not look weird?)\r\n* Wordplay and linguistics (I WILL look up the etymology of that weird word, and use it for a godawful pun three weeks later. Or maybe three seconds later.)\r\n* SPREADSHEETS (there is nothing as exciting as well-formatted data! How do you rate this list?)\r\n* Music (Anything with a strong melody really. Strong lyrics to sing along to in the car, and high-energy stuff for workouts)\r\n* Nerdy documentaries on unnecessarily specific topics (like a 6-hour dissection[i] of a game about being a kid spending summer vacation in rural japan, and its thesis about childhood)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot more, especially in terms of dabblings I don\u2019t actively pursue (genetics, crafting, proper walking technique, celtic knot drawing... etc.), but this list is long enough as it is. Time to nonsequitur!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy sense of humor trends to postironic tastes, where something is both sarcastic (funny because it is false) and sardonic (funny because it is true) at the same time. The phrases that get reactions like \u201cokay, that\u2019s technically correct but...\u201d or \u201cthat is absolutely not how that works! ...but maybe it has a point\u201d, and especially \u201cthat\u2019s stupid but correct/useful/great\u201d. My true masterpieces are the ones where I say something which is deeply but subtly wrong, and you nod in casual acceptance until, \u201c...wait a fucking second-!\u201d Oh, I also enjoy silly and absurdist humor, too (like tone whiplash). You might have noticed that one already.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love the process of self-improvement. I used to think I wanted to be the very best that no one ever was, but then I took a closer look at the leaderboards. The games I am good at and most enjoy, I am consistently in the top 10% of the global rankings, except when I am in the top 1%. I found it didn\u2019t matter to me. I don\u2019t want to be better than other people, I want to be better than me. I don\u2019t care about being good, I care about being better. Improvement is itself the joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Dating Philosophy\r\n\r\n\r\nI've started trying to date without expectation[j]. Supposedly, as the ancient wisdom goes, if you live without expectation you are ready for anything. As the much less ancient but much more wise Mister Rogers said: \u201cLove isn\u2019t a state of perfect caring. It is an active noun like 'struggle.' \u201d The most important parts of love aren't found, they are built. Intimacy, trust, safety, chemistry; these things don't form in a day, or even a month. These are the sorts of things that come from having been together through thick and thin, that are made of time and shared experience more than anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has led me to a very \u201cfriends first\" mindset. I don't want to focus on the future at the expense of the present. Those moments of connection in the present are what the future is built of and on. Worrying about what a lifetime together would look like makes no sense without first understanding what a week or month together looks like. I want to give that natural rhythm time to breathe and grow, to settle in to familiarity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m Looking for in a Partner\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are, depending I guess on how you count, about four things I\u2019m really looking for in my future life partner. They\u2019re not immediately actionable issues, usually requiring gradual building of intimacy; they\u2019re more like my areas of long term interest and focus. I\u2019m sure these aren\u2019t the only things I want, but these are my dealbreaker values. They are, from most to least important, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first is a mutual confidant. The kind of intimacy and trust that we can -- and more importantly, *do* -- share our secret thoughts with each other. Beyond being merely friends or close, I want our relationship to be a safe space. I want to represent safety and security to you, and I want to be able to find safety and security in you as well. I want you to be the dependable constant in my world that I can retreat to when life gets hard, and I yearn to provide that service as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second is friendship and companionship. Shared activities and aimless conversations. Someone who I can regale with whatever weird articles or dumb memes I stumbled across online that day, someone who tells me about the drama their coworkers keep starting. Watching shows or playing games together, or going out to the park or whatnot. I have some preferences on activity choice, but I\u2019m not picky here; what matters to me is that we have fun things to do together and we enjoy ourselves doing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third is a focus on lifestyle compatibility. This isn\u2019t exactly something I\u2019m looking for in a partner, so much as a value I am observing. A huge part of relationships is the things that aren\u2019t fun, or the things so mundane as to escape notice. Doing chores, standards of cleanliness, what temperature is the bedroom, do we share a bed and/or bedroom or do we sleep separately, how are objects stored and organized around the house, and hundreds of other minutiae. This is a big deal and it\u2019s the make-or-break (especially break) of many (if not all) partnerships. I\u2019m not going to try to litigate that out here, -- it needs to be a conversation -- but it\u2019s worth preparing this idea in our minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth and finally, kids. I don\u2019t want kids right away, but I do want them some day. Probably one or two. I have a lot of natural inclinations both as a teacher and as a parent, and I want to channel them. Kids are great. Childrearing is another very complicated subject which, much like home lifestyle choices, tends to be assumed first and only considered once conflicts emerge. It\u2019s definitely not a first date conversation, but it\u2019s something that should be talked about before making a permanent commitment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, this is in many ways a description of a relationship, not a partner. That\u2019s somewhat unavoidable, as the two concepts are deeply intertwined and, well, definitionally inseparable. But you were probably hoping for some more person-scale descriptions to see if you match them, yeah? So here's that nice bullet point list of melodramatically pretentious trait descriptions you ordered:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Integrity. Both in terms of personal responsibility, and a pride in precision. To be specific when speaking and cut off misunderstandings and ambiguities[k] before they happen.\r\n* Playfulness. This one is mostly literal and also one of the most important. It\u2019s important to have fun, even when doing something serious. The desire to toy with things is one of the traits I find most attractive and full of depth for connection. A mischievous streak is a bonus.\r\n* Conversation. I love to talk, at length. Sharing stories, investigating some random factoid, snide banter, and otherwise just experiencing the mind of another. This is a very important level of connection for me, and I find the ability to speak openly and honestly very precious.\r\n* Honesty. Not in terms of not telling lies, but as a commitment to tell the truth. To be the one who speaks up when something is wrong, even when it is uncomfortable.\r\n* Curiosity. I like people who try to learn and understand the world around them. To push past surface level comprehension and hunt for the details.\r\n* Understanding and Growth. There are a lot of things people don\u2019t know or are bad at. Not in terms of some mystical conspiracy, but just generally people aren\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s important to forgive people for being imperfect, and to show some grace. This is even more important in a relationship: There will be misunderstandings, there will be conflicts. In order to make anything lasting, both of us will need the maturity to talk about what is wrong and the flexibility to learn and change.\r\n* Self. I want a partner with an inner fire. I want someone with the audacity to be herself and to shape the world to suit her needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLifestyle; or, What I\u2019m looking for in a relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk more about lifestyle compatibility, as expressed through the metaphor of  Forgettable Wednesday[l]. It\u2019s pretty fundamental to how I\u2019m approaching relationships these days. To paraphrase, marriage is mostly made of life (not the magical reality-defying of dates), and life is mostly made of ordinary forgettable things. Boring things, frustrating things, and unimportant things. Trips to the grocery store, getting stuck in traffic, and sitting at home after a rough day at work when you\u2019re too tired to do anything. An okay relationship can survive that stress. A great relationship makes those situations enjoyable, or at least lessens the burden. Ultimately, living with a partner means living with a partner, and that\u2019s a lot of arguments about how messy the sink has gotten if you can\u2019t come to a consensus on how to manage such things.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, my lifestyle has existed in so many different forms, each unrecognizable to the others (yours probably has too); I\u2019m a person and I change. My love of learning and growth and constant self-improvement can lead me to rather drastic and sometimes sudden changes to large portions of my life: I once went from watching 6+ hours of youtube daily to none, because I felt it was becoming a burden. I once went from only doing things online to attending distant events four days a week, and then a few months later dropped all of those events and started a new workout routine. There\u2019s also a time when I had the same meal for breakfast for five years straight. It\u2019s hard to guess what has longevity and will remain interesting or sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human mind is capable of astonishing levels of self-modification; if you can show me a different way to live, I can incorporate (at least parts of) that into my own lifestyle, and I\u2019ll probably want to. Maybe being with a wonderful person will remove some of my hangups: Perhaps I won\u2019t find certain things so difficult, or I\u2019ll find a hidden joy in something I had dismissed. Or perhaps you\u2019ll introduce me to something entirely new, and I\u2019ll make space to rebuild my life around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, what would living with me look like? What do I want out of that?\r\n\r\n\r\n* I\u2019ve lived my whole life in the Bay Area. I don\u2019t particularly comprehend the alternative[m], but there are places like Portland and Seattle where I might not notice the difference. I'm not tied to the specific location and I'm at a place in my life that I could move anywhere, but I'm not sure what living elsewhere would be like or if I'd enjoy it.\r\n* Despite the plethora of things I like to do at home, I grew up outside. I don\u2019t just mean the near-daily trips to the zoo, but my grandfather[n] would take me on hikes every week to go birdwatching. I\u2019ve been backpacking with the boy scouts and such, and I never want to give up proximity to nature... but also I\u2019ve become okay with \u201cwimp camping\u201d full of modern conveniences, or not camping at all anymore. \ud83d\ude05\r\n   * I am the kind of person who could comfortably not leave their house for several consecutive months[o], and also the kind of person who can go on a ten mile hike by accident. That\u2019s not an exaggeration, I\u2019ve done that dozens of times.\r\n* I love doing things together[p], even when I couldn\u2019t manage them alone. Going to the movies by yourself just feels wrong, you know? There\u2019s a bunch of things I like doing with others that I can\u2019t bring myself to do by myself. Minigolf, bowling, movies, hikes... I\u2019m sure there\u2019s also plenty of things I\u2019ve never thought of that I\u2019d love getting dragged along to.\r\n   * I value time spent together very highly, but we can\u2019t spend all our time together. Not just from a practical standpoint (e.g. employment) but there\u2019s no activity so good you never need a break from it. I don\u2019t know what that balance will look like; I\u2019m sure it will vary based on which interests we align on.\r\n* The kitchen will be clean! To a like, 80% degree! Dishes can briefly soak in the sink in extreme cases, but they best be moving to the dishwasher within a day. Pots and pans do not sit dirty after a meal. If anything, I will clean them before I eat. Other parts of the house are whatever, but the kitchen is a place of industry and therefore it needs to retain baseline operational capacity. For the rest of the house, I\u2019d much rather stay clean by not making a mess in the first place, and neat and organized can look nice, but as long as things don\u2019t get cluttered I accept that any space that people actually live in will succumb to some level of chaos[q].\r\n* I love trips to faraway places, but I\u2019m perfectly content with 0 to 2 such trips per year. I hate the process of traveling, the anxiety of making sure I\u2019ve packed everything, and getting through an airport without anything weird happening (track record is startlingly bad). I love being there on the other side though!\r\n   * There\u2019s still a lot of places I\u2019d love to visit someday. The waterfalls of Iceland, another trip to South Korea or Japan, Australian wildlife centers, Germany, maybe another stay in Patagonia or New Zealand just because they\u2019re pretty...\r\n   * Also, maybe having a partner with me will ease my hangups? If you turn out to be better at managing the parts I struggle with, perhaps I can enjoy the rest of it without reservation and will join you on monthly vacations. Who knows!\r\n* I am not a pet person. I am especially not a rambunctious puppy person[r]. I love animals, but I find living with them exhausting. If I am going to put in that much work, I want things in return that they can\u2019t give. Old dogs and certain cats are alright because they\u2019re calmer and relatively self-sufficient, and terrarium pets are great because I can ignore them and they don\u2019t mind. But if I\u2019m gonna have a small energetic disaster living in my home, I would hope it is a human child. Those at least learn to talk.\r\n* Cozy time is important. Talking about each other\u2019s day, what we\u2019ve seen and read and done recently, plans for the immediate term future, and assorted random nonsense. Time to cuddle and simply be together. I value this one a lot, it\u2019s probably the second most intimate thing I can imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I\u2019d like to know about you\r\n~~ AKA ways to introduce yourself to me when you\u2019ve run out of ideas ~~\r\n\r\n\r\n* What\u2019s your trashy comfort fic? Do you read litRPGs, HP fanfic, edgy vampire teens? Romance novels or shoujyo manga, chuuni shounen, Deep Lore stuff? Also, B-movie horror or kung fu flicks qualify. What\u2019s your fiction vice?\r\n* What did you do this week that you don\u2019t normally do? Nobody ever has a truly \u201cnormal\u201d week where everything colors inside the lines of their regular schedule. So: Did you make progress on a project, or go on an adventure - maybe by accident?  What stood out to you, what did you find interesting about this week?\r\n* What\u2019s a super cool place or event you\u2019ve been to? It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be travel. A really neat museum, a friend\u2019s unforgettable wedding, that one playground you wish you were small enough to go back to, or any sort of chaos so far out of the ordinary it defies categorization. What is a memory you cherish?\r\n* Any thoughts you have on dating. As a process, as a commodity in the dating app world (and why you turned to dateme docs[s]), how it does or should function, the dysfunctions to avoid, past experiences that guide your present, or your current philosophy. I'm especially interested in things you dislike about dating and how you would change it, as I would love to incorporate those lessons. It\u2019s always a fascinating topic to hear how different everyone\u2019s perspectives and experiences are in this field!\r\n\r\n\r\nCall me, maybe?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this far! If you didn\u2019t actually read this far and just skimmed to the bottom, thanks anyways for still being interested. If you want to date me, think we would be a good match, or just want to chat and go on some outings, send me a mail at elathrain@gmail.com. Tell me a little about why, and something about yourself!\r\n[a]Congratulations! If you can read this, you now have access to the proper reading experience.\r\n[b]I'm a man of wealth, and taste \ud83c\udfb5\r\n[c]I remain open to discussing various degrees of open relationship and/or my partner being poly so long as I\u2019m their primary partner, although personally I am monogamous by nature. (Besides, finding a first partner is hard enough! \ud83d\ude02)\r\n[d]This seems to always horrify people that I drive this far. No really, it's fine.\r\n[e]For those of the discerning eye: Why yes, I did in fact change the font to Times New Roman just for that name. The kerning on the lowercase gamma is *unforgivably _awful_* in Arial.\r\n[f]My friends started asking some \"who would win in a fight\" questions that got really out of hand.\r\n[g]I stick to indoor bouldering gyms. I like knowing there are mats if I fall even if I rarely need them. It lets me go all-out and push my limits safely.\r\n[h]Weird how this point isn\u2019t formatted the same huh? That\u2019s gonna bug someone...

    ProfileText: "\ufeffKyle West Date Me Doc\r\n  \r\n\r\nHello all! I\u2019m trying out this new approach to a dating profile in the hopes that it allows me to paint a fuller picture of who I am and what I\u2019m hoping to find in a girlfriend and, God willing, a future spouse. I\u2019ll leave my contact info below; if you think we might be a good match, please feel free to reach out. Alternatively, if you are reading this and think I might be a good fit for someone you know, I would appreciate it if you passed the doc on!\r\n\r\n\r\nA Bit About Me\r\nI\u2019m 32 and live in the greater DC area. In the past year I finished my Ph.D. in Ancient History and started a new job teaching Classics at my undergraduate alma mater, a small Christian liberal arts college. I love introducing my students to the fascinating other world that is ancient Greece and Rome (fair warning, I\u2019m told I can overshare a bit when it comes to the details of my favorite subjects. \ud83d\ude42) Contributing to college students\u2019 growth and success at this crucial stage in their lives is a major component of what drives me. I also have a strong desire to publish books that will advance scholarship in my field. My dissertation looked at ways that Romans thought about disability and incorporated (or failed to incorporate) people with disabilities into their society.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a practicing Christian in the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod and, though not always perfectly, I try to make faith the bedrock of my life. I had a journey from a Baptist background in my childhood into the Lutheran tradition, and my commitment to that theology is important to me. However, it\u2019s certainly something I am happy to discuss as I get to know someone. I hope you find theology a stimulating discussion topic on dates! My hope for a partner is that we could build a family, including kids, that centers itself on Christian worship. This would shape many of the rhythms of our home life, and it would also mean putting down deep roots in the local congregation. If I had to pick the most important thing I am looking for in a spouse, it would be someone who also finds this vision compelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne last thing I think it is important to be upfront about; my interest in studying disability is rooted in personal experience. I was born with cerebral palsy, a physical disability that impacts my mobility and motor coordination. I use a mobility scooter to travel longer distances outdoors, and a cane off-and-on when I walk. I do have to adapt to some unique challenges, but with hard work, support from the ones I love, and the grace of God, I have built a life that I\u2019m very thankful for. One of the Biblical passages that holds the greatest meaning for me comes from John chapter nine. Jesus says about a man born blind that it was not because of \u201cthis man\u2019s sin or his parents\u2019, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nMom and Dad\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nMy Interests\r\n* Classic literature\r\n* Fantasy and sci-fi (These first two items together make for fairly eclectic tastes. I\u2019m the sort of person who might simultaneously be reading a Star Wars Expanded Universe novel and Anna Karenina. \ud83d\ude1b\r\n* Games (almost any genre and format, board, video, party, take your pick)\r\n* Live theater (both attending and performing, especially Shakespeare)\r\n* Travel (especially to historically significant locations, and especially in Europe)\r\n* Movies and TV (Some favorites, It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, The Lord of the Rings, The Wind Rises, \u201cChuck,\u201d \u201cCommunity,\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d)\r\n* Dogs (specifically, wanting my own golden retriever since about the age of six is pretty much a core memory.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Strengths as a Partner\r\n* Strong Sense of Loyalty and Duty: This one is very much a value inherited from my Dad. If we are committed to each other, I will stick by you. This is true when it comes to my friends, but I\u2019m also confident it will be true towards my wife. And specifically in a marriage, I will strive to live by the knowledge that my calling is to lay down my life in service to you.\r\n* Unflagging Romanticism: If our relationship takes off, I will write you poetry at some point. \ud83d\ude42\r\n*  I Love Sharing What I Love: Basically, nothing makes me happy quite like helping others fall in love with things I think are awesome. My family pokes fun at me sometimes because of how much I like to watch people\u2019s reactions when I introduce them to things. And I make it a point to show that same enthusiasm when people I care about are sharing their interests. If we have the chance to date, I hope I\u2019ll experience something new thanks to you!\r\n* Intellectually Stimulating: If you value book smarts and good conversation, you could do worse. \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m Looking For\r\n* Someone who will help me grow in my faith.\r\n* Values family; eager to have kids.\r\n* An empathetic and kind orientation towards others; practices hospitality, such that together we\u2019ll be able to be a blessing to my students and our community.\r\n* Intellectually Stimulating: My ideal romantic partner is also a partner in learning and conversation: we should help each other reach new heights intellectually as well as spiritually.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, thanks for giving my slightly long-winded thoughts your time. \ud83d\ude42 My email is kyle.west@wheehaa.com. If, perhaps, you are intrigued, I look forward to hearing from you!",

    ProfileText: "willium \u2014 dating\n\u2190\nDating Profile\nJAN 2024\nOver the last couple years, I've gotten a lot more serious about finding a life partner. This piece is an exercise in outlining who I am, what I bring to a relationship, and what I'm looking for in a partner. I've often struggled to articulate these things effectively, so I've decided to sit down and write this, however cringey it may be. In large part, I'm writing this for myself, but I guess it might help to share it too.\nIf you think you're right for me (or have someone in mind),\nplease\nreach out\n.\nAbout Me\nMy name is William Wolf\n(\nn\u00e9 Strimling\n).\nI'm 29 years old,\nbut I'm a bit of an old soul. I generally find that I relate more to people older than me. I'm on the cusp of Gen Z, but I'm definitely more of a Millenial at heart.\nI am 5' 7\" (~169cm) tall,\nif height is important to you\n. It's probably the thing I'm most self-conscious about and also my superpower, because I find that it causes people to underestimate me.\nI have a large, blended family.\nMy parents are divorced, and each has a new partner. I have three siblings: one biological sister, a step-brother, and a step-sister. I'm the youngest. I have cousins I don't have much of a relationship with, and second-cousins once-removed who I see often. There are also many people I consider family who aren't related to me at all.\nI grew up in Piedmont, CA\n, which is just across the bay from San Francisco. Most of my family still lives around there.\nI hate San Francisco because I love San Francisco\n.\nI went to the University of Washington\nin Seattle, where I studied Computer Science. I didn't really like Seattle. The weather was too dreary, and I found the people standoffish. That said, I don't think there's anywhere in the world more beautiful than Seattle in the summertime.\nI love to\ntravel\n.\nI always feel like I haven't done enough of it. New York City is home right now (and the best city), but San Francisco is the center of my world (both personally and professionally), and my heart is in Tel Aviv. Eventually, I'd like to live a life that allows for traveling frequently or even living across multiple places.\nI'm a creative technologist.\nI know that term sounds kind of bullshity, but it's the most descriptive way I've come up with of describing the work I do. Right now, I'm the founder of a venture-backed tech startup (my second one). In the past I've been a software engineer, a product designer, a product manager, a visual journalist, and a researcher. I'm most interested in the ways technology can help bring people closer together \u2014 which was the basis for my current startup and my previous one. You can learn more about my professional career on\nmy website\n.\nI am Jewish,\nand had a Bar Mitzvah, but am not very religious otherwise. However, I resonate a lot with Jewish values and find a lot of belonging in Jewish communities. So, I think of it as being an important part of my identity. I have also\nlived in Israel\n, and consider myself a Zionist.\nI am socially progressive and fiscally moderate.\nI think alignment on politics is important, so, briefly \u2014 I believe love is love, you can identify however you want, and that a woman should be empowered to choose to end a pregnancy. I support social safety nets, universal health care, and regulation against anti-competitive business practices. I love America; it's not without its faults, but I love how it enables class mobility, supports entrepreneurship, and fosters unparalled diversity.\nI'm an avid reader.\nI enjoy reading everything from contemporary fiction, to German literature, to dense biographies, to research papers, to popsci, and everything in between. I used to read 50+ books a year, but now it's closer to one every other week.\nI live an active life.\nI exercise almost every day, usually for about an hour. I enjoy weightlifting for fitness and as a sort of meditative activity. For recovery, I've been getting into yoga. For cardio, I try to run or erg 2-3x a week. As trite as it sounds, I really like walking, and try to get in at least 15k steps per day. I also enjoy hiking and snowboarding, but don't get to do either nearly enough.\nI try to eat well,\nbut don't follow a strict diet. At one point I followed a ketogenic diet, but I found that obsessing about carbs was itself unhealthy, and, more importantly, it made me unhappy. Being flexible about what I eat is one of my greatest joys \u2014 I love trying new foods and cuisines without much consideration for ingredients. That said, I do my best to avoid processed and fast foods.\nI don't smoke or do drugs.\nI sometimes drink alcohol, but almost never to the point of being drunk. I have infrequently smoked weed in my life, but it's not something I'm into. I have tried psychadelics too, but again, it's not something that's important to me.\nI'm fairly extroverted.\nI prefer being around people and enjoy meeting strangers. I maintain a lot of friendships including childhood friends, college friends, work friends, and random people I met at parties, hostels, and coffee shops. I'm not really into \"going out,\" for the most part. I find crowds overwhelming, and I vastly prefer sitting and having a conversation with someone. I love dancing, but mostly poorly at home, rather than at a club.\nI take life pretty seriously.\nI like to have fun and go on adventures, but I don't think anyone would describe me as care-free. I find what makes me happy is focusing on what gives me purpose (my work, helping people) and what gives me belonging (family, community). I love investing in relationships and projects. For most things I do in life \u2014 I'm in it for the long-haul. I don't give up easily on people or on things I believe in. I do what I say I'll do, and I show up.\nI'm ambitious, but not goal-oriented.\nI love to build things, and I get most excited about projects that have the potential to effect change at-scale in some way. I also\ntry\nto constantly challenge myself and compare myself only to who I was before, rather than to other people. I think it's nice to have goals, but either you don't reach them and feel an undeserved sense of failure, or do reach them and ask yourself \"now what?\" Instead, I try to focus on continuing to find ways to do what I love to do, so long as I'm able to provide for myself (and eventually, my family).\nI pride myself on being\nself-reliant\n.\nI don't want to ever depend on someone else for my happiness, safety, or sense of purpose.\nI love drinking tea.\nI got really into it during COVID, in lieu of baking sourdough bread. Now I collect tea, and enjoy the ceremony around it. I also love the vibe of sharing tea with friends and strangers \u2014 I find it to be intimate in a way that alcohol and coffee are not. In my senior year of college, I even did a tea-related\nsocial experiment\n.\nI practice monogamy.\nAs a rule, I don't really do 'casual' relationships, and the idea of seeing multiple at the same time gives me anxiety. I've been in two significant long-term relationships, each about 4 years long, and a few serious, shorter relationships. Ultimately, each relationship ended because we either grew apart or wanted different things.\nAs I've gotten more serious about dating, I've also become more picky. I still lead with my heart and don't care so much about your body or how you identify, but I do care about your values, habits, and goals.\nIn other words,\nI care about what you care about\n.\nPersonality\nEnneagram\n(\nabout\n)\nBig Five\n(\nabout\n)\nMBTI\n: EN(T/F)J (\nabout\n)\nAbout You\nI want my partner to value family.\nThis starts with me and you, in addition to our respective families. That doesn't mean you need to have a great relationship with your family, but ideally you aspire to. I want kids, but I am open to adoption and fostering \u2014 I believe every kid deserves a loving home, and if/when I have the means, I'd like to find a way to open mine to those who don't have one.\nI want my partner to value community.\nHopefully you care as much as I do about being an active member of your community and society at large. It doesn't matter if that means volunteering in a soup kitchen, working at a summer camp, running for office, or something else entirely, as long as you like to be involved in our world.\nI want my partner to believe in something.\nYou should be generally optimistic about the future. I find nihilism and pessimism exhausting. Ideally, our beliefs are mostly the same, but it's more important that you arrived at yours independently and respect my own. You should also care about politics and social issues, possibly to the point of activism \u2014 I find this is a good proxy for people who care about society and their place in it.\nI want my partner to contain multitudes.\nI think it's important that no one belief or aspect of your identity should dominate your personality.\nPer Walt Whitman\n, I find the mark of maturity is the capacity to simultaneously hold a set of beliefs that are apparently contradictory.\nI want my partner to value health and fitness.\nThis is a big part of my life, and it matters a lot to me that we both prioritize living a long, healthy life, for ourselves and as role models for future kids. To me, this looks like abstaining from smoking and addictive drugs, limiting alcohol consumption, and having a lifestyle oriented around being outside and moving your body.\nI want my partner to be ambitious.\nI actually prefer that it's not in the same way I am. It might be through your career \u2014 maybe you're a doctor, lawyer, artist, or are trying to effect change in the world through a newsletter you write. I think it's even possible to be ambitious about family. All that matters is that you have a growth-mindset, and happen to the world, rather than letting the world happen to you.\nI want my partner to be curious.\nI love learning about new things, and I want to share that with my partner. Maybe you value continued education, or read the news every day, or fall down wikipedia rabbit holes regularly. It doesn't matter really how you're curious \u2014 I just have a hard time relating to people who accept things at face value and don't ask \"why?\"\nI want my partner be well read.\nIt could be pulp romance; I just think reading says something about your attention span, and demonstrates an interest in engaging with new stories or learning new things.\nI want my partner to be Jewish,\nbut I'm open minded about this. I was not raised to be particularly religious, am not religious now, and don't believe in any conventional definition of God. I have also never adhered to\nHalakha\n. However,Judaism is important to me for three reasons:\nI like the culture. I find the traditions very meaningful, and like that they've persisted over generations.\nI found a sense of belonging in the Jewish community, especially in my twenties, and especially in Israel.\nI find that this is a good (though imperfect) proxy for a set of ineffable values that matter to me in a partner.\nI want my partner to be my partner.\nWhile this may seem tautological, it's important to me that our relationship is a partnership where together we are greater than we are individually. We should contribute different things to the relationship, and support each other in our individual endeavors. We are a team \u2014 my success is your success, and vice versa. Instead of allowing adversity or conflict to come between us, we approach everything that comes up as\nus against the problem\n.\nAbout Us\nI'm pretty open-minded about where life takes me long-term, so I hope you are too.\nPictures of Me",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffSo, first of all, some clarifications!\r\nDespite using the F label, I\u2019m actually a transgender girl not in transition yet and, despite being from Europe, the \u201cCentral Europe\u201d label is not technically correct because I\u2019m from Italy, in Southern Europe, but that was the closest label choice lol.\r\nI am looking for a serious long term relationship. I am looking for people in Italy,and Europe (not more distant, sorry). I can do long distance relationships as well, but with the idea of ending the online part at some point and hopefully meeting some times a year if you\u2019re far.\r\nI won\u2019t immediately show pics because I am very shy and I value privacy, so please bear with me. Also, please if you\u2019re looking for a very feminine looking trans girl, I\u2019m not for you.\r\nPlease, READ EVERYTHING before actually texting me.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INFO:\r\nMy name is Angie, I\u2019m from Italy and I currently study psychology.\r\nI have a lot of passions that I often refer to  as my \"sweet distractions\", because they often consume my time, energy but especially what I should be focusing on lol.\r\nI like music, especially classical music and in fact I play the violin sometimes. I am also really interested in games, especially Nintendo ones. I have been a long time Pokemon player (I know a lot of things about the series) and I also really appreciate Animal Crossing. There are many games I haven't played and I am willing to play them at some point.\r\nI also find the Linux world very interesting, despite not being a big expert (I installed Gentoo though!) and I love languages. I have studied several languages and I am an intermediate in French, while I am trying to learn Japanese whenever I have time (spoiler: I don\u2019t). I don't really watch a lot of movies because I tend to prefer TV series and anime. About anime, I haven't watched a lot, but my favorite ones include: Evangelion, Steins;Gate, Code Geass and Bocchi The Rock.\r\nI am a pure introvert and I like my alone time, which results in me learning the most random stuff out of curiosity and giving space to my creativity. I also write sometimes. I am not really good at communicating in real life at first, but I can get better with time.\r\nI am an atheist, but I don't mind what religion is my partner as long as they respect my boundaries and don't force me into anything (even because it won't probably work lol). I find Taoism and Buddhism quite interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY APPEARANCE AND PERSONALITY:\r\nI am pretty tall, standing at 6'1 (186 cm) and 73kg (convert it yourself, but yes I am normal weight) and I am not really a sports person, even though I don't mind taking long walks and swimming.\r\nI might not be the most appealing, but I am really kind. I am often told to be nice and calm. I value loyalty and calmness. I like listening to people, but I get very involved if we share passions.\r\nI am very rational and I am quite conscious. I like being analytical and carefully plan my choices.\r\nI do have a dark side as well. I tend to be pessimistic and sometimes I could sound almost cold, but I promise you I\u2019m not at all.\r\nI do have some personal struggles, but I won\u2019t expand on that for now.\r\nI also deal a lot with dysphoria, and unfortunately it\u2019s something that I will probably have for life.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFESTYLE:\r\nI am a pretty healthy person. I have a varied diet and will eat almost everything, but I eat very healthy food. I don\u2019t smoke and I don\u2019t drink. I can be a good social drinker though. \r\nI don\u2019t exercise at all, but I\u2019m looking forward to improving on this. Overall, I am a pretty healthy person. \r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT I AM LOOKING FOR:\r\nFirst of all, people in Italy, but in general in Europe.\r\nI am very open on relocating, but my conditions are:\r\n* Not outside Europe\r\n* In a Country that is knowingly open to LGBT people and has good laws for them\r\n* In a city, but not too small\r\nDespite being bisexual, I have a strong preference for cis men and that\u2019s what I am looking for. I don\u2019t really have any preferences if not for the fact that, like many girls, I\u2019d like my partner to be taller than me.

I enjoy being home and just chilling, but I also like to hang out  and travel with friends.\r\n A small green rectangle to divide sections of the document \r\n\r\nHOBBIES\r\nI am sort of an anxious person so I like to do activities that calm me and don\u2019t stress me out.\r\nFor exercise, I do crossfit 5 days a week and have been practicing japanese ju jitsu for a few months.  I like doing crossfit. I started in 2016 but left during the pandemic and just got back to it a few months ago.\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhen I have time, I like DIYing around my house, trying to make my home more homey and pretty. \r\nI enjoy hanging out with friends, going out for drinks and/or dinner. I also like spending time at home, just cuddling with my cats, and maybe watching a movie/tv show/youtube  and/or looking up stuff online.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI love camping. I enjoy being really close to nature. I like the idea of figuring things out and trying to get by on few things. I\u2019m not a \u201csurvivalist\u201d but I like the idea. I prefer camping on the mountains, maybe near a river, but camping on the beach is nice too (as long as it\u2019s not too hot and there aren\u2019t swarms of mosquitoes).\r\n  \r\n\r\n A small green rectangle to divide sections of the document \r\n\r\nEDUCATION AND PROFESSION\r\nI have a bachelor\u2019s degree in Advertising and Civil Engineering.

This is K speaking.\n(I'll tell you my name later, of course. Even my shoe size. Just not sure how this 'going public with loads of seriously personal' works yet...)\nI'd like to start with some controversies, if I may - they should tickle your interest buds, all being well.\nAnd there you go, the first one has just\nlanded\n, and even without intent!\nI make up phrases in English sometimes, quite probably because it is my second language. But aren't your interest buds all the merrier now that they know they exist?!\nFor illustration\n(\nthough, a non-linguistic one\n):\nphotographic evidence of the moment when my nephew and I invented the 'simultaneous reverse swing selfie' 10 years ago.\n(I've made the whole sorcery into a 12\" video but this site wouldn't... so this is the end frame, as you can tell from the catharsis on our faces.)\nalrighty then, on with the controversies...\nI love hiking\nbut hate camping\nthese two loonies\nI wasn't supposed to befriend because\nI am allergic to dogs\nbut I've walked them for a friend with the greatest joy dozens of times\nbest sound and smell!\naaand I am allergic to dust \ud83d\ude29\nI'm creative (in some ways)\nand while you might not get the sense instantly, I'll have you know that I've just done an online test and it says it is one of my signature strengths, OK?!\ntime to get back to the allergies...\nI love dogs, horses and cats are OK, too, but if you have any of these living in your house, we'd be in a pickle...\nBut hey, don't write me down as 'the allergy girl'! I might be lactose intolerant and vegetarian, too, but no hayfever can sweep me off my feet!\nJokes aside (hope you've been having the time of your life so far), I'm a heterosexual female, 178 cm tall and 60 kg, give or take, and an atheist. I turned 40 three months ago, which feels so recent, but if you think about it, that's one Q already... \ud83d\ude36\nI live in London normally (but presently unemployed so sticking it out in a cheaper place) but if a job offer took me to Copenhagen, Stockholm or Amsterdam by any chance, I wouldn't weep my eyes out. (I love bikes and definitely prefer cycling to public transport... but not just for the bike culture, of course!)\nI work in project management in the creative industries but I've just completed a short course in environmental sustainability and oh my, there's just so much potential in so many areas of sustainable development! I firmly believe that if anything, technology and science will save humanity from exterminating this planet but there's so much everyone can do! I hope you agree with that and don't let climate despair get the better of you!\nI hate waste in any of its forms (materials, time, money, energy....). I wish I had the skills of a chemical engineer to invent more ways to upcycle/recycle waste. Or the powers of a social psychologist to ignite a grassroots movement that would turn overconsumption into something society would end up frowning upon and would eventually lead to global behavioural change... (My folks call me naive at least once a fortnight so it's OK if you think I'm a bit too far into wishful thinking, don't worry.)\nLacking the skills of scientists, though, at least I have a skeleton idea of a dark comedy tv show (in terms of flavour, think of a layered cake of Boat Story, Back to Life, After Life, and, me, of course) that would stick it into the faces of local governments (and the main one) re how much more they could actually do (or try to do) to solve/ease a bunch of social and environmental issues at local levels. We'd be following the stumblings of a 40-something main character who is completely lost on the tracks of self-development (but sane, just kind of driftwood-ish a bit), and circumstances make him/her settle into a small town community, and we watch in awe how these stumblings sometimes turn into brilliant solutions to problems without the main character's slightest awareness of his/her role in them... anyway, I could go on but you'd need to sign an NDA. However, if you have any ties to Two Brothers Pictures or Harry Williams or Jack Williams (the two brothers) or their EAs or their PAs or their postman, get in touch this instant, of course! (Ricky Gervais' management agency I had tried already, the most junior of their junior staff bounced me off in a blink of an eye, albeit, politely \ud83d\ude42 )\nBut yeah, if not changing the perception of the population about overconsumption and overproduction, there are still a billion things to try, right?! I did some decluttering a couple of months ago, took crates of items to a market with the intent of donating the proceeds to animal shelters. Luckily, I managed to sell a dozen items or so. Then winter came, the books got soaked right after unpacking one time so I took the whole thing online. I created a website, photographed hundreds of clothes, books, utensils, knick-knacks, and spent ages uploading and describing everything and getting word out on local social media... then 3 books and a cheesegrater got bought. But hey, the intent was there!\nDreaming of having a small abode right by a lake\nThis spot is my favourite so far but I'm happy to go for an old Scandinavian villa on sale for peanuts with you, to do up while I can swim a lot and make lots of hot beverages for us. Or a Mediterranean little house? With colder drinks?\nAre you also scanning social media channels like cheappropertyeurope and such daily? (Ours will have solar panels and a heat pump and all the clever things, OK?)\nI asked a friend to describe me as this seems to be a frequent advice re dating profiles... so this is from her (and I am all blushing while typing):\nA clever introvert with such integrity but little confidence.\nShe values tranquility over fanfare but she is all in for adventures and creating memorable experiences.\nKeeps lots of her ideas to herself despite being a creative person, possibly due to being afraid (that lack of confidence thing...).\nIntelligent, great sense of humour, quick on the uptake but a bit sceptical first about new things. Sometimes it takes a bit of letting guards down but after that she is a truly loyal, trustworthy friend, by your side through thick and thin.\nShe is monogamous and would go for problem-solving without hesitation rather than throwing it all in way too soon. She expects honesty and loyalty in return as well: once trust is gone, it would be a rocky road winning it back.\nThe person who will fall for her (who will seriously want to make her happy) will get a most devoted wingman (woman), that's for sure. And the two of them will carry around laughing their heads off, probably. She is such fun when there's no need for walls.\nThere. Can you believe all that praise?!\nEmbarrassingly\nlovely, isn't she? But she has known me since I was about 3 years old so... \ud83d\ude2c\nAnd you know me a little by now, too, don\"t you? - let's get pragmatic and avoid wasting each other's time (if that's the case) because wasting is so insanely stupid.\nI guess this aversion to waste accounts for my thriftiness and indecisiveness. For me it takes longer to decide on a purchase or an action plan than for most people - and if you are the kind of clever guy I'm after, it might have already clicked for you that what I'm trying to do with the best intentions is just another form of wasting, i.e. wasting time under the illusion that I'm working out the optimal usage of resources.... \ud83d\ude43\u00a0 how dumb, huh?! If you'd found me out, get in touch by all means. I could definitely welcome someone in my life who catches me out when I should be. And the best would be if you were patient and easy-going, too. Or just patient.\nI don't seem to be attracted to men with long hair and I am not keen on facial hair, either (I have a theory that circa 98.7% of men sporting a beard or a moustache would look incomparably more handsome without them. There's such a tiny segment of the male population who might actually benefit from growing facial hair that I could almost elevate this theory into a general rule. But I won't, cause I respect the rights of those 1,214 men to attractiveness.).\nI prefer not being taller, stronger, faster, fitter or heavier than my man.\nI'm not planning on having kids so it would be great if you didn't have/want any, either.\nI guess I am just writing this whole novella because I wonder if there's a chance after you have already lived half of your life to find someone who can add kindness and smiles to the remaining years while you want to add the same to theirs because you both understand how precious companionship actually is. Just looking for a team mate (whom I quite fancy), I reckon.\nYou don't need to be a dashing prince with wealth or have a great sense of style but as long as your sense of humour is ace and you like to fool around while also being aware that no relationship can get far without respect or honesty and that maintenance on it will most probably be needed along the way, too, we could be in for something.\nBe old enough to know that you carry the responsibility for all you do and say but young enough to still want to venture out there and enjoy tomfoolery. (38-46 would cover that, you think?)\nbirthday present\nloved it! (I mean, I didn't get the plane...)\ngood to become friends\nwith strangers who bring your food\ndidn't get this aircraft, either\nbut maaan, holding out your phone on a trike for a photo when there's absolutely nothing underneath is a thrill!\na full body shot\nis probably also expected... Serious face was art director's doing.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffTanner\u2019s Date Me Doc \r\nRead on, rock on, and let me know if you want to connect! I am looking for my fellow beautiful nerd!\r\nName & pronouns: Tanner, he/him\r\nAge: 40 Height: 5'9\" / 175cm\r\nLiving Location: Groningen, Netherlands; American born and raised in the United States\r\nStudies: BSc in Psychology, MSc in Environmental Psychology\r\nOrientation: Straight, looking for a woman aka spirit-animal level\r\nRelationship type: Monogamous/ish (I\u2019d like to establish an outstanding relationship with a partner prior to adding the complexity of a third party), I would like to raise kids with a partner and starting this process at the same time going on that particular adventure together, looking for the right partner to do life with.  \r\n\r\n    \r\nMy life as a film logline: A romantic adventure about a guy (40) who worked in IT, tv/film, and finally finished 4 intense years of university (psychology), now seeking to find a forever partner in this beautiful wide world.\r\nHobbies: learning the mandolin, learning Dutch, lindy hop swing dancing, independent films, long-distance cycling trips, hiking, skiing, writing, personal development, scuba diving, community organizing, improv, reading, writing.\r\nMy personality traits using HEXACO, which has the most validity and reliability of such psychological assessments, is Openness 96%, Conscientious 98%, Extraversion 96%, Agreeableness 95%, Emotional Stability 97%, Honesty-Humility 96%; all of these percentiles are plotted relative to a normal distribution.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends/Colleagues/People I Know\r\nHello beautiful people whom I already have the pleasure of knowing. If you are worried about \u201cruining the friendship,\u201d I can promise with very high confidence that won\u2019t happen. If you\u2019re worried about looking foolish if you try and we do not click, I can also promise that I\u2019ll always have nothing but respect for people who show vulnerability to reveal who they really are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout Me\r\nI was born in a small town near the border of Utah but located in Colorado (US citizen, US passport). Losing myself in nature came natural to me as a child, exploring the thin air at the tops of mountains, the lush forest, and the arid badlands; losing myself in nature continues to be a lifelong love of mine. It took me some time to rediscover my bliss compass and how to use it, but once I learned (including via cognitive behavior therapy i.e., talk therapy), it opened me up. It took me on my own hero\u2019s journey where I left the world of IT and my self-imposed invisible retaining wall, and opened myself up to vulnerability and intimacy with others. I explored storytelling and storymaking, working in Los Angeles in tv and film. I served, near the Aegean Sea, the needs of people fleeing war and hardship in refugee camps. Then I relocated to the Netherlands and returned to university dedicated to becoming a psychologist so that I could use that knowledge to help people in relation to our greatest societal challenges, earning a BSc in Psychology and MSc in Environmental Psychology. Along all these journeys I learned to be open, to try everything, to say yes, to embrace uncertainty (most of the time), and to be intimately attentive and responsive to my intuition.\r\nIn each stage of my journey, it became increasingly important that I understand the problems and sufferings of people and more-than-humans so that I can do what I excel at\u2026bring very different people together and co-develop and bring about solutions to these consequential problems. I once heard a quote that \u201cone must save themselves before they can save the world.\u201d\r\nI\u2019ve always been a late bloomer (or felt like I was a late bloomer). Late to learn to tie my shoes; try alcohol; achieve the death of my ego; have the feeling of falling in love; going on the university journey, embracing the beauty of my own body; deciding I want a forever partner (note: I\u2019ve never been married); deciding I want to raise a family (note: I have no children). And as a luminous late bloomer, I am using this time to find my beautiful other.\r\nI have a great amount of genuine curiosity about the world and about people. As such, I discover many incredible beautiful souls and I like nothing more than bringing all of these extraordinary humans together so they can also fall in love with each other. I am a natural bringer-together of people. Example, the JamesWebbSpaceTelescope group where we have dinner parties and discuss the beauties and properties of the universe while reviewing the latest awe-inspiring imagery coming from the telescope (of the cosmos), with attending explanations of the image content. Recently I kicked off a book club focused on The Artist Way (by Julia Cameron) where we share our thoughts, feelings, challenges, and difficulties together as we complete the workbook.\r\nI am an empath, loving, affectionate, careful, and honest. I love to dance and most recently am taking lindy hop lessons. So long as I can be verbally and artistically expressive, I am full of glee, kicking off the covers in the morning and dancing my way through life :) I am a deep listener, present, communicative, and I\u2019m told I give extraordinarily good hugs. I adore deep conversations and love the unfolding of all manner of topics, experiences, and reflections in creative-flow conversation.\r\nIt is important that I live congruently with my values; I\u2019m going full vegan this year (2024) as it is important to me I do not cause harm to other creatures and that I live within the planetary boundaries. I now know too much about the reality of this moment so I am prompted to action. While I am a scientist I am also an artist and am spiritual. I am spiritual in the sense of feeling and reflecting on the fact that I am but one output of the universe, made of atoms that have their own lineage of existence; I explore, ponder, and rejoice regarding my own connection with the cosmos. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I Sing the Song of the Universe\r\nI am involved with practical transformations of society to achieve an existence of humanity within the planetary boundaries (e.g., depart from neoliberal economics for thrivenomics?), equality, and justice for all, while also caretaking for the more-than-human creatures. In my profession and as a hobby, I build communities. Professionally, I co-run a non-profit non-extractive consultancy that conducts research, drafts scientific-literature-based interventions, and performs project management of transition projects, all regenerative, to achieve societies that thrive within the planetary boundaries. As mentioned earlier, I used to work in IT where I would bring all the stakeholders and team members together to achieve alignment in succeeding or failing at achieving our goal as a team. With my shiny new MSc in Environmental Psychology, I do something similar but in relation to helping to move our societies into the safe/thriving zone regarding social services and planetary resources i.e., the safe and just space of the Doughnut Economics model.\r\nI also volunteer for causes that I see as virtuous, currently with Extinction Rebellion, Scientist Rebellion, Scientist4Future, and community organizer for local regenerative non-extractive food growing/consumption. Before that I volunteered with a community theater, political organizing, Make a Wish foundation, and refugee camp aid volunteer/emergency responder.\r\nMy core values are:\r\n* generosity\r\n* honesty/transparency\r\n* empathy\r\n* joy/bliss\r\n* deep listening/presence\r\n* interdependence \r\n* being in the moment\r\n* Playfulness\r\nHere are some visuals that are ever constant in my world:    \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traits I am looking for in a partner:\r\nI would love to find a special someone who is:\r\n1. Kind to others, compassionate, empathetic, interdependent approach, authentic, curious, interested and motivated \u2013 someone who ranks high on emotional intelligence and goes out of there way for meaningful exchange; let\u2019s their curiosity lead them to investigate/research, pursues interests, is proactive bliss motivated rather than fear pushed.\r\n2. Warm, joyful, silly, playful - someone who radiates warmth, love, and joy; who has a playful sense of humor and doesn't take themselves too seriously; who finds joy in connection and in making others feel good about themselves.\r\n3. Impact driven \u2013 take notice of societal issues and takes action to bend the needle of the moment  in the direction of the good and just; a person who acts congruent with their well-defined values; who does meaningful work congruent with those values, and that they feel good about their efforts (either professionally or as a volunteer or donor or as a side project).\r\nI am quite active, flowing through life and trying out all the entrees. In sport (fencing, snowboarding, marathons, etc.), in art (improv, dancing, mandolin-learning, etc.), and I guess I\u2019d call it \u201cexploring\u201d (volunteering, long cycling trips, hiking, top rope climbing, scuba diving, etc.). Additionally, I spend a great share of my time with loved ones (friends, family, and I hope soon a partner); with romantic relationships I am quite physically affectionate (as a psychologist, I thought I\u2019d mention that my attachment style is secure attachment). I think I would be well matched with another who correlates with a good deal of the above. I am looking for one also marriage-minded/forever partner and I am also keen to raise a family.\r\nI\u2019d love to create a partnership that is rooted in mutual consideration and support, is embedded in community regeneration, and is full of emotional and physical affection. \r\n\r\n\r\nWant to connect? \r\nI\u2019d love to hear from you! Email me at datingtanner@proton.me. You definitely don't need to have your own date me doc, but it would probably be helpful to include a bit about     yourself, some photos, and what made you want to reach out! *The cat below isn\u2019t mine ;)\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nBonus\r\nWow, you are thorough! In the merrymaking of being thorough and transparent, I should mention that I utilized a fair bit of formatting and some content from the following sources:\r\nDate me. Daystar Eld.

I have lived with my maternal grandparents since I was a child. Later, I moved to several places to study in primary school, junior high school, and university. In fact, I am a person who likes stability, but I am also willing to accept new things and cultures.\r\nHainan\u2192Guangdong\u2192Hainan\u2192Shandong\u2192Guangdong(Shenzhen)\r\n          (aged0-5)     (6-14?)

I can\u2019t go to many places. I\u2019m under a lot of pressure after work, and I don\u2019t have enough free time to go to far places, such as going abroad.

I am driven by love and a strong desire for deep connections.  In my life, I care the most about relationships and personal growth.  I\u2019m authentic, easy-going and highly capable.  I\u2019m a kind and happy person with a lot of love to give, but I just haven\u2019t come across the right person for me yet.  Maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and this document will reach someone whose soul matches mine. \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\n\r\nIn hopes of finding someone highly compatible to me, here are the things that most describe the essence of who I am from the inside out: \r\n \r\nI FEEL \u2013 I am emotional and tactile, so I\u2019m all about feeling.\r\n \r\nEMOTIONS: I feel intensely, and I LOVE it.  I\u2019m the kind of person that will certainly risk having my heart shattered in order to feel the depths of what love has to offer rather than to avoid emotional pain at all costs.  I am definitely NOT avoidant, and though I feel so much, I am extremely resilient.  There\u2019s a confidence that comes from being able to trust in how you feel and not become so easily confused by your own conflicting emotions; to still be able to know where you truly stand despite being pulled in many different directions.  I am very emotionally intelligent and I\u2019m looking for the same in a partner - this is the realm where I need to be matched with someone, first and foremost.\r\n \r\nSENSORY: As a kid I was always pretty athletic, probably because I\u2019m more of a tactile learner.  I\u2019m hands-on and handy because of it.  For most things, even as a beginner I would do pretty well initially because of translatable skills.  Even if I\u2019m not fully cognizant of a connection, I can rely on having good muscle memory.  I feel alive when I get to connect through my body.  I partner-dance.  Merely saying that I do it is a gross understatement.  When I dance with another, I access my deepest self \u2013 lost in the emotion of the music and the energy exchange between two people willing to meet at the same place.  When I dance with others, I\u2019m in another world.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI CONNECT\r\n \r\nI was the love child, so my initial purpose was to keep my parents connected, especially through long periods of separation (my dad was in the Navy and my parents immigrated here from the Philippines).  I was, hence, born to connect, and it\u2019s a major component of who I am.  Clearly, I like to connect on the dance floor, but really, I\u2019m open to connecting anywhere.  I\u2019ve never been a fan of small-talk; I much prefer a deeper connection.  I am open and vulnerable; unabashedly myself, because I\u2019m not afraid to be seen.  Hell, I WANT to be seen.  I want to really know a person on a soul-level and vice versa.  I live for that level of connection; that degree of intimacy.  I\u2019m an extrovert so shared experiences are what I enjoy most in life, and I long to bare and share my soul with someone I know that I can trust to be responsible with me because they already practice accountability.  This is another extremely important characteristic that I need to be matched in when it comes to partnership.\r\n \r\n \r\nI DO\r\n \r\nI\u2019m a doer.  My primary love language is Acts of Service (followed by Quality Time and Physical Touch).  For me (and to me) actions do speak louder than words, though I\u2019m not frivolous with my words \u2013 I care about accuracy, so what I say and what I do are indeed in alignment.  As I mentioned before, I\u2019m handy and that\u2019s because I like to do things and enjoy learning to do things.  I have a problem-solving mind that supports my desire and ability to do the things.  I\u2019m incredibly capable and very willing.  There\u2019s almost nothing I won\u2019t do for the people that I love, for I am an Enneagram Type Two \u2013 The Helper.  I don\u2019t half-ass; I give it everything I\u2019ve got. It\u2019s the only way I know to \u201cdo\u201d; it\u2019s the only way I know to be.\r\n \r\n \r\nI GROW\r\n \r\nPersonal growth has always been important to me.  I grow fast because I keep in-check the biggest obstacle to this \u2013 myself.  I\u2019m incredibly self-aware.  Because I\u2019m very honest with myself and have a problem-solving mind, I\u2019ve been able to figure myself out all along the way.  It also helps that I\u2019m a good listener and I consider; everything.  Even if I don\u2019t agree with something, I still consider what might be useful nonetheless.  I\u2019m open-minded and a bit unconventional at times.  I seek truth and meaning on my own terms.  Because I connect, I\u2019m good at putting things together, and with my heart as my trusty compass, armed with emotional intelligence, I Learn, and because I learn, I Grow.\r\n \r\nSadly, this is the realm where I find that I keep running into incompatibility in relationships.  As I\u2019ve just written this last paragraph above, I\u2019m now seeing how many of my natural skills and abilities come together to make personal growth almost seem easy for me.  At times I\u2019ve encountered feelings of jealousy, intimidation or competitiveness around this because understanding myself well enough to grow effectively has ultimately given me confidence in my own self-worth \u2013 so those who don\u2019t harbor as high of a level of self-worth within themselves tend to find some issue with me. \r\n \r\nIt wasn\u2019t until I turned 40 that I realized that the roots of my pattern of ending up partnered with people with low self-worth lay in my familial relationships \u2013 primarily that of my father and my sister (so much for being a quick-learner! Lol!\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).  I\u2019ve been conditioned, since I was young, to make accommodations for their inability or disinterest in growing when it comes to emotional intelligence; expected to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d and just accept that they love me, even though my feelings would never get a voice or consideration.  As a result, emotional invalidation is my biggest trigger, but now it\u2019s also become a clear indicator to me that a person may be lacking in self-worth.\r\n \r\nI\u2019ve been duped by partners who say they are just as interested in personal growth, but lack the self-awareness to fully achieve it (clearly another absolutely necessary characteristic for someone to be well-matched with me).  I guess, deep down, I must have been wanting to step up to this battle, time and time again, hoping that I may prevail for once; effect change and rewrite the ending to the story.  Now that I am armed with this deep understanding as to why I\u2019ve invited this energy into my life for so long, I\u2019m finally ready to break the cycle and change the course of my relationship-fate.  I don\u2019t need to fight this fight anymore.  If someone feels threatened in any way by my own sense of self-worth, I cannot trade any of my own in order to bolster theirs.  Though it is my nature to try to \u201chelp\u201d and I am more-than-willing to sacrifice in the name of love, I can\u2019t fight someone else\u2019s own personal battles for them.  \r\n \r\n \r\nI\u2019M HERE\r\n \r\nI am uncannily present.  It makes connection easy with me, and you can feel the difference when you dance with me or if you\u2019ve experienced deep friendship with me.  Relationships mean more to me than anything else in life, and because actions speak louder than words, I am astoundingly reliable.  Since I\u2019m honest with myself, I\u2019m also honest with others in what I can or can\u2019t handle, and hence, have a pretty high success rate of showing up when I\u2019m supposed to/needed.  I\u2019m easy going and adaptable if things need to change on the fly.  I\u2019m typically not attached to outcomes; just care to be there in any way I can.  I just really care.  When I serve my community, I feel alive and often seem to be in constant motion.  I definitely don\u2019t sleep enough.  Because I\u2019m extroverted, I find more within me when I have someone to be there for, and I\u2019d rather be alive than asleep.  My soul is fully awake and I live in the now.  I don\u2019t dwell on the past; I learn from it.  I don\u2019t expend my energy worrying about the 'what ifs\u2019 of the future.  Instead, I try to make the now count as much as possible toward the future.  I am fully present and ready to engage.\r\n \r\n \r\nI AM READY\r\n \r\nI know what it means to be ready.  Since my very first serious relationship ended in 2005, I felt \u201cready\u201d to have a kid.  Becoming a mother was, after all, the only thing I\u2019ve always known that I wanted in life, but even though I felt ready at the time, I kept waiting for the right person.  After 15 years of hoping that the right relationship would come along, I felt like I couldn\u2019t wait any longer so I set out to do it myself.  I found a great donor and impregnated myself at the age of 37 via a diva cup and an inversion table (I told you I was unconventional).  I. Was. Ready; ready to feel my body throughout the changes over the next nine months and ready to feel every bit of what it takes to bring life into the world.  Perhaps because I was so ready and intentional about it, it worked on the first try and I got the baby girl I\u2019d always wanted!  My wonderful daughter is now three years old.\r\n \r\nI\u2019m strong, emotionally and physically.  I\u2019d like to say mentally, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve really tested that (I\u2019m a fan of Survivor, so it gives a different perspective on what being mentally strong looks like).  Because I\u2019m hands-on, I want to stay strong for my daughter, so I go to the gym.  I want to keep myself ready to remain fully engaged in her growth and development.  She is at the heart of who I am and everything I do, but I still have more love to give.  After fulfilling my own dream and ensuring that I could have my child on my own terms, I am now even more ready for partnership.\r\n \r\nI\u2019m made for partnership.  I\u2019m a team player and I am conscientious and intentional about working toward the longevity and sustainability of a relationship.  I have the good sense (and experience) to understand the ramifications of struggling in a partnership where you are ill-matched, and I now understand that even though on a soul level you can feel like someone is your person, it doesn\u2019t work if you\u2019re not both ready at the same time.  I need someone who\u2019s ready to BE a partner; ready to be THE partner; AND ready for family life.  It\u2019s the final criteria in the list of characteristics that I need to be matched in.  Without all four of these things, a partnership is not likely to work, for either of us.\r\n \r\nI am ready for a true teammate; ready to talk about all the things: past relationships, individual journeys, deepest desires, bucket lists, family, adulting, parenting, keeping the flame alive, conflict resolution, the inevitable failing of health, etc.  I am ready to devote myself and plan for a future where we can support each other and grow together.  I\u2019m ready to prioritize the family that we create whether we build it, meld it, or merely sustain what we have.  At the moment, having another child is still potentially viable for me if it\u2019s in the stars, and that works for me regardless of whether I\u2019m paired up with a man or a woman.  I am open to doing it all over again in a loving, supportive partnership.  Of course, there is an expiration date on the possibility for me to conceive again, but fortunately, not in regard to a relationship.  I waited 15 years to have my child and I\u2019m willing to wait as long as it takes for the right person in partnership, if there is indeed a true match out there for me.\r\n \r\nI have practiced being in relationship.  I have practiced living with others.  I have practiced being there.  I have practiced stepping up.  I have practiced nobility.  I have practiced giving.  I have practiced enduring.  I have practiced letting go.  I have practiced growing.  I have practiced resilience.   I have practiced humility.  I have practiced humanity.  I have practiced loving with all of my heart.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI have practiced being the type of partner that I want to have.  Now I\u2019m ready to welcome the right person into my daughter\u2019s and my life.\r\n \r\nI am ready to be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf who I am resonates with who you are, then let\u2019s connect to see if we are well-matched and if there\u2019s a spark.  If you\u2019d like to first know more about me and start becoming acquainted, the best way to reach me is at sheeniebeenie@gmail.com.  If you found me through OKC and want to send me an intro, then please start it with \u201cMy, oh, my\u201d, although, because I don\u2019t pay, the message may easily become lost in the ethers. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to learn about me.  Even if we\u2019re not a match, I wish you the best of luck on your own Date Me Doc search.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffShould You Go To Mars?\r\nMy name is Mars (Mark Nadal), a 32yo (1991) male kitten mostly in SF. photos\r\n\r\n\r\ni thought I was 1% weird but my intense life experiences have caused me to discover I am 0.0001% divergent - as in, probably sub 8000 people across all 8Billion globally could keep up with my lifestyle:\r\n\r\n\r\nI average 4 hours sleep per day, work as a porn performer, javascript developer, dad of 2 kids, traveled 40 countries, Supreme Court paralegal, am a runway model, work with nonprofits, engineered systems with 60M users, consulted with the CIA & Navies, been chased by an LAPD helicopter, kicked off planes (and fallen out of them), conduct controversial psychic research, do poetry, am a landlord & investor, economist & scifi novelist.\r\n\r\n\r\nwe\u2019re certainly incompatible if you\u2019re looking for a partner to experience things \u201cfirst time\u201d together, that boat has long sailed. Here are relational positions that I have/had with partners, ranked in order of desiring preference:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. coliving + filming + babymaking (as monogamous or non-exclusive)\r\n2. coliving + filming (as monogamous or non-exclusive)\r\n3. coliving + babymaking (non-exclusive, monogamous)\r\n   1. everything below as non-exclusive\r\n4. filming\r\n5. fwb + coworking\r\n6. partner\r\n7. teacher/\u201cstudent\u201d\r\n8. date\r\n9. friends\r\n10. stripper (me)\r\n11. ons/fns\r\n\r\n\r\nBabymaking requires that I get to raise and homeschool them, ideally parenting as a family together, though some career women have been interested in birthing but letting me raise them (though I do require child support in this case).\r\nFilming, if you didn\u2019t pick up, is of pornographic nature. Though i\u2019m deeply interested in SFW content creation with friends or partners too.\r\nI\u2019m accustomed to being the breadwinner (and caretaker) but I\u2019ve been exploited too many times by \u2018friends\u2019 and \u2018partners\u2019 on this, so I\u2019m likely to trust you less. I get super turned on by the woman paying - i\u2019d totally be a sugarbaby if i could, my spirit animal is an apartment kitten raising his little ducklings.\r\ni\u2019m a sub, this means i like to be on bottom but will dom if asked. I identify as lesbian, and apparently have an anomalously high sex drive (averaged 3x/day with cohabitating partners, 1/day low end, 12x/day high end - as in yes, sustained every day, day after day, week after week, for months) as it supercharges my productivity everywhere else in life. I have extremely high levels of compersion, meaning I get pleasure from and aroused when my partners have sex with others or imagine me as someone else, I like to be used as a toy. I\u2019ve never cheated on anyone during 13 years of monogamous relationships.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffLexi's Date Me Document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction:\r\nHello, wonderful souls! I'm Lexi, a 25-year-old cisgender, heterosexual female on the quest for someone who shares my zest for life (orange ya glad you\u2019re here)\ud83c\udf4a, has a love for nature, and possesses the magic of social and emotional intelligence. I spent a few years in Big Pharma, but I got out because I wanted to wear the white hat (Olivia Pope reference). I am now in education. I work as an Admin Assistant in a public high school.   \r\n\r\n\r\nDrugs? I work with children. I don\u2019t snort, puff, or partake in drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrink? I like craft beers, however, I am on a holistic alcohol-free journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: Wisconsin/ 608.920./ USA Midwest\r\n\r\n\r\nFramework:\r\nI am a science nerd. I love science and will always be an advocate for communicating science effectively. As a writer, I believe there is always a story to be written. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am a proud black woman. I believe in women\u2019s rights and that women should have the autonomy to choose if they want access to abortion services. From a historical framework, I believe in the importance of CRT. I am a product of the black diaspora. I am multilingual (not to brag or boast). I am Fluent in English and Spanish. I am nosey in French. And conversational in Dutch. If you are a fan of banning books in schools/public libraries, please leave this page. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout Me:\r\nI'm a spirited individual who finds joy in life's simple wonders. From exploring enchanting trails to savoring a tranquil sunset, I believe in cherishing every moment. My friends describe me as warm, empathetic, and always ready for a good laugh. I value deep connections and believe in the power of understanding and emotional resonance.\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I'm Looking For:\r\nI'm in search of a man who is kind, gorgeous, generous, funny, and sweet. Ideally, you aren't afraid of traveling via a plane, and you have an active passport\ud83c\udf0d. You have your own and can hold your own. Someone who shares my passion for nature, someone who can revel in the beauty of the great outdoors. Whether it's a weekend getaway immersed in nature's embrace or simply appreciating a stunning sunset together, I hope to find someone who finds peace and joy in these experiences. Additionally, a partner with social and emotional intelligence is someone I'd love to journey through life with.\r\n\r\n\r\nKids: I don\u2019t have any (I work with them all day). I want a minimum of 35 passport stamps and collective cultural experiences before popping out a kid. I don\u2019t want to raise a child in America. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy Interests:\r\nNature Adventures: Hiking, Kayaking,  Being outside, and any outdoor escapades.\r\nMindful Living: Practices like meditation and yoga to maintain balance.\r\nCultural Exploration: Delving into new cuisines (with a special emphasis on flavors and spices), attending live performances, and embracing diverse cultures.\r\nReading: A bookworm at heart, always eager for the next captivating read.\r\nDancing. \r\n  \r\n\r\nFood Section:\r\nI have a deep love for the rich tapestry of flavors and spices that food brings into our lives. Exploring diverse cuisines is a delight, and I believe that a good meal is an experience to be savored. It's important to note that I am allergic to seafood, shellfish, and all water creatures. Additionally, I follow a dairy-free lifestyle (85%). I can\u2019t consume raw dairy. Despite these limitations, I relish the challenge of creating and enjoying delicious meals that align with my dietary needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I Offer:\r\nLoyalty and Support: I believe in being a steadfast partner, ready to weather any storm. Monogamy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdventurous Spirit: Always ready for new experiences and crafting lasting memories.\r\nCommunication: Open and honest dialogue is the foundation of any relationship. I am committed to expressing thoughts and feelings with clarity and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I'm Not Looking For:\r\nI'm not interested in casual flings or relationships lacking depth. Polygamy isn\u2019t my thing. I value connections with substance and am seeking someone who shares similar intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing Thoughts:\r\nIf you're someone who adores nature, possesses social and emotional intelligence, and enjoys a culinary adventure with a focus on vibrant flavors and spices, I would love to get to know you better. Let's embark on a journey together, exploring the wonders of life and building a connection that stands the test of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe we might be a great match, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see where this journey takes us!\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: email me (hellolexii101 at gmail dot com)",

Nice is telling me what I want to hear; kind is telling me what I need to hear. The former prioritizes keeping the peace while the latter prioritizes growth and accountability.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore of a slow burner than a spark chaser. I like to establish a strong foundation of friendship and get to know someone well prior to anything else\r\n\r\n\r\nLove to laugh. My sense of humor can be characterized as witty, punny, and/or eccentric\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermined to reduce sentient suffering through chronic disease treatment and prevention, precision medicine, and microbiome research\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways up for good conversation, civil debate, or a walk in the park! Prefer experiences to things\r\nThe Nice-to-Haves  \r\nIntrigued by both the arts and sciences: Consilience is a personal life philosophy, along with Sagan\u2019s \u201cPale Blue Dot\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowth mindset: Person in progress, perpetually in beta, like to learn by trial and error, constantly iterating\r\n\r\n\r\nFinding common ground with people of all walks of life: I believe there is something to be learned from everyone we meet and want to avoid the trap of living in an echo chamber or falling prey to confirmation bias\r\n\r\n\r\nCook most meals at home, albeit to manage disease symptoms and with a limited repertoire\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t take myself seriously: Life is short, why waste valuable time on public opinion? But I still value constructive criticism!\r\n\r\n\r\nPassionate about minimalism, stoicism, and intentional living\r\nResilience would probably be my dominant trait; I\u2019ve endured more chronic illness suffering than most people see in a lifetime  \r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy banter, improv comedy, DIY, Tiny Desk concerts, scicomm, podcasting, & trivia\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen to children and adoption, strong nurturing instincts\r\nThe \u201cNeeds Work\u201d\r\nAmbition outstrips physical limitations\r\n\r\n\r\nHealing from trauma related to medical gaslighting, neglect, & abuse\r\n\r\n\r\nPredominantly secure attachment style but can display anxious traits, such as trouble advocating for myself and voicing needs and limitations during bouts of severe illness\r\n \r\nNot too comfortable with large crowds on account of dysautonomia, potential for mast cell triggers, and the social isolation that accompanies chronic illness\r\n\r\n\r\nChronic illness affects my daily life in many ways. Most prominently, my energy is limited, I experience 24/7 pain, and maintain a somewhat small radius.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this may change in the future, I currently can\u2019t meet people for coffee or drinks and prefer walking through nature or doing something outdoors as alternatives.\r\nA Few Favorites\r\nBooks\r\nNonfiction\r\nConsilience, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Pale Blue Dot, Burn: The Misunderstood Science of Metabolism, Exercised, A Brief History of Time, The Rest is Noise, Thinking Fast and Slow, Attached, The Trouble with Passion, Getting Things Done, Nonviolent Communication\r\nFiction\r\nSix Degrees of Separation, The Sound and the Fury, To the Lighthouse, The Phantom Tollbooth, Tuck Everlasting, Invisible Man, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Waiting for Godot, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Franny and Zooey, Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, Far from the Madding Crowd, Letters to a Young Poet, Calvin & Hobbes\r\nMovies (partial to coming-of-age stories and documentaries)\r\nAkeelah and the Bee, Jumanji, Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting, Back to the Future, The Sound of Music, The Rainmaker, A Few Good Men, The Shawshank Redemption, Matilda, Say Anything, The Illusionist, Stand and Deliver, Critical Thinking, School of Rock, Dangerous Minds, Freedom Writers, To Sir With Love, The Imitation Game, Theory of Everything, Pi, Hidden Figures, On the Basis of Sex, Queen of Katwe, Little Man Tate, The Hate U Give, The Color of Friendship, Hala, Coda\r\nMusic (will listen to nearly any genre or language)\r\nRosal\u00eda, Sad\u00e9, 112, New Edition, Jacob Collier, JoJo, M\u00fda, Chloe x Halle, Arooj Aftab, Fleetwood Mac, Ludovico Einaudi, Bond String Quartet, Maldita Nerea, Seal, Dave Koz, John Tesh, Vivaldi, Dave Matthews Band, U2, Sting, The Police, Sarah McLachlan, R.E.M., Duran Duran, Rolling Stones, Metallica, Nirvana, Pink Floyd, Death Cab for Cutie, Within Temptation, Regina Spektor, The Doors, Sara Bareilles, Simon & Garfunkel\r\nTelevision Series\r\nLessons in Chemistry, Dark Matter, Big Bang Theory, Young Sheldon, Good Trouble, The Chase, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Gentefied, Superstore, Speechless, Friends, Loot, Little Fires Everywhere, Little Voice, Swagger, Las Azules, Normal People, The Queen\u2019s Gambit, Jeopardy!, Whose Line Is It Anyway?\r\nPodcasts & YouTube Channels\r\n3blue1brown, Primer, Physionic, Veritasium, Kurzgesagt, Sabine Hossenfelder, Vox, More Perfect Union, Johnny Harris, Diary of a CEO, The Proof with Simon Hill, Elizabeth Filips, Jay Clouse, Big Think, Heidi Priebe, guitaro5000, The Well, What I\u2019ve Learned, Answer in Progress, Nick Norwitz\r\nSchools of Thought, Ideologies, Values, Interests (loosely held)\r\nAutodidacticism, minimalism, polymathy, multipotentiality, compatibilism, intersectional feminism, universal basic income, disability policy reform, patient advocacy, systems biology, network medicine, healthspan extension, 80,000 Hours\r\nJust for Fun\r\nParticipated in SSC\u2019s 2019 Annual Adversarial Collaboration Contest\r\n\r\n\r\nAttended in-person Jeopardy! auditions and met Sarah from the Clue Crew\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderably double-jointed\r\n\r\n\r\nDropped out of college due to health challenges\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t put much stock in personality tests, but MBTI deems me an INTJ-turned-INFJ, Enneagram pegs me 4w5, analyst according to DiSC, and a questioner (someone who fulfills internal but not external expectations) in the four tendencies framework\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anything here resonates, I\u2019d love to get to know you!

Still, I see this period as temporary while I build my career. My top priority is ultimately spending time nurturing relationships and family.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love expanding my passions for psychology, healthy & delicious foods, meditation, wellness, chuckling at comedy, immersing myself in art, and soaking up nature. \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m ready to make new friends and a best friend (to have a family with and) to share life\u2019s adventures with. Please feel free to say hello on IG @asandylion or email sandylaca19 @ gmail.com. Tell me what you look forward to most this new year! I appreciate you taking the time to read my profile. Wishing you an awesome 2024! \ud83d\ude00",

I guess that you are reading this and maybe don\u2019t understand why am I trying to find someone at this young age. I can say that I am really want to find this kind of true love we can read about in the books, when your family is your world and beloved is trying to be protective, supportive and kind for each other. Luckily, I grew up in that kind of happy family, so I understand what I'm trying to find. \r\nI am from Russia and I am a future teacher of russian language and literature. I love kids and I am a nerd sometimes, so it is perfect combo for my profession:) \r\nAlso I am playing in the small theatre, it is not well known and popular in my town, but, believe me, it has his own charm. I\u2019m optimistic, active and loving person. I adore books, especially classics: Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev. My favorite book is \u201cAnd Quiet Flows the Don\u201d by Mikhail Sholohov. It is a heartbreaking novel about family, friends, terrible, but realistic war and relationships between people. \r\nI think it\u2019s enough for the first time. Have a great day!",

    ProfileText: "\ufefff  \r\n\r\n\r\nHey, I\u2019m Ariane, a 43-year-old singer-songwriter and author. Don\u2019t get ideas, I\u2019m not swimming in a bath of cash like Taylor Swift and JK Rowling, though watch this space.\r\n\r\n\r\nI live in East London: breathtaking sights I have seen here include a man throwing up in a bin, and a grotty sofa which seems to have permanent residency, which I have dubbed the Sofa of Shame. I bet you can\u2019t wait to visit my area. This isn\u2019t a euphemism.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d like to date someone aged 35 to 55 who is kind, funny, honest, respectful, smart and communicative and doesn\u2019t throw up in bins.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you\u2019re tolerant of grumpy teenagers, as my professionally sarcastic daughter turns 13 this year. She is currently majoring in eye rolls, sighs and slammed doors. She is also super-smart, hilarious and very sweet. I see her 50% of the time; the other 50% she\u2019s with her dad and stepmum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I enjoy: witty repartee, long conversations, jokes, reading the papers, reading fiction, self-development books, Apple Fitness+ and Apple products, tea in bed, walks, coffee shops, cinema, comedy gigs, interior design, meditation, hanging out with friends, and yoga (I have mastered the fine art of not farting during classes).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the blurry photo below, taken today, I\u2019m currently slightly plus-size (yes, this is a nice way of saying fatty boom boom) though my New Year\u2019s resolution is to lose all the weight. In mitigation, I have a pretty face, which will look all sad if you don\u2019t want to date me because I\u2019m temporarily horizontally-challenged.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and mixed race (half-Persian, half-American). My daughter looks white, so I call her my Secret Asian. I\u2019m a Londoner but also hold US citizenship, so I get to vote against Trump this year, which will be the best vote I ever cast. I\u2019m monogamous. I\u2019m also cis (she/her), an atheist, liberal, and an LGBT+ ally. I have several amazingly kind and funny close friends, both female and male, and an exciting, busy and fulfilling life. I\u2019m just missing someone lovely to share it with.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m intelligent (Countdown champion and Brainteaser winner), amusing (if you don\u2019t think so by now, there is no hope for me!), creative, ambitious, and this all feels like blowing my own trumpet (speaking of which, I play five instruments but that isn\u2019t one of them). I have my own Wikipedia entry but still want to achieve much more, including a number 1 pop album under my artist name Ariane X. I\u2019m signed to a tiny record label and am releasing my debut album Better in July 2024. I absolutely can\u2019t wait as I\u2019ve wanted to be a pop star since I was 12 years old. Yes, I\u2019ve left it a bit late.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tend to like people who are thoughtful, creative, kind, funny, interesting and interested in others, good listeners but also willing to open up. Communication is really important to me - ideally we\u2019d text a lot, but I\u2019ll allow you breaks to go to the toilet. (This is a joke! Do not screenshot it and post it on Twitter with the red flag emoji.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the nicest things about life is unexpected pleasant surprises, so if I intrigue you then do get in touch. I start my day by completing every single New York Times puzzle: maybe you\u2019d like to do them with me? \r\n\r\n\r\nariane.sherine@gmail.com / Twitter: @ArianeSherine",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffBasics\r\nGender: M\r\nAge: 33\r\nLooking to Date: F\r\nOpen to: Long term, short term, friends\r\nLocation: San Francisco (south beach)\r\nHeight: 6\u2019\r\nThis Doc Created: Dec 30, 2023\r\nMe\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDate me doc that my ex made for me after we broke up about 1.5yr ago (she wants kids and I don\u2019t)\r\nLife\r\nI grew up in Berkeley, Ca, and if you listen very carefully you can still hear the granola crunch. Until recently, I\u2019ve always lived in co-ops and group houses (5+ people), and really love most things about group living. I recently moved to my own place, but still value this sort of community and try to stay involved with group houses where I\u2019ve lived in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really like being active outdoors. In the past that\u2019s involved a lot of cycling, especially mountain biking. These days I still bike almost everywhere I go, but tennis is my go-to physical activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m vegetarian and reduce my consumption of animal products where convenient: I don\u2019t buy milk or eggs, but I don\u2019t worry about products that contain them (particularly with dairy), and do eat some cheese.\r\nWork\r\nCurrently, I work at an AI company because it seems like helping AI go well (or rather, helping it not go poorly) is potentially very impactful. I care a lot about my work because of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow I got here: I studied physics because it was interesting and I value humans understanding the world. In grad school I found out that doing good was so neglected that you could save a life for a few $k. I took a job with a highish ability to donate while figuring out what to do next. GPT-3/scaling-laws happened next, and I decided that\u2019s what I could be most useful doing.\r\nYou (long term partner)\r\nI\u2019m a rather rational, analytical person and I think I\u2019d like to find someone who is as well, but also someone who\u2019s kind and cares about the welfare of others.\r\nUs (long term partner)\r\nIn previous long-term relationships (most recently 6yr), I\u2019ve really enjoyed having someone to cook a quick meal with after work, then get outside with for a tennis match or bike ride, and finally cuddle up to half a movie, back rubs, or just reading and chatting. I\u2019m pretty affectionate, and physical contact and emotional warmth are important to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually it\u2019d be amazing to face life as a team, optimizing jointly for what\u2019s best for both of us. We\u2019d support each-other\u2019s growth where wanted and work together towards being the people each of us wants to be and living the lives each of us wants to live.\r\nKids\r\nShort version: no kids\r\n\r\nLong Version: I don\u2019t want kids any time soon, and I\u2019m more comfortable committing to not having kids than to having them. The rest of this decade is potentially a particularly important and crazy time for the world, and I\u2019m not totally sure what my life or the world will look like afterwards. Depending on what the world looks like in ~2030 I\u2019m potentially open to kids then.\r\n(Non)-Monogamy\r\nI\u2019ve been in various mono/open relationships in the past and am open to most relationship types as long as there\u2019s clear and open communication about it. The important thing to me is finding the right person.\r\nContact\r\nI\u2019m <wampiter at gmail dot com> and facebook.com/wampiter",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffWhy Get Italian for Takeout When an Italian can Take You Out  \r\nHey, I\u2019m Rocco. A 35 year old, cisgender, straight, male, with no kids, looking for a monogamous relationship with a woman. INFJ personality type. I currently reside on the Michigan/Wisconsin border in the US. My mother was 100% Italian ethnically, so I am Italian American, I graduated Valedictorian from a Finish American University, and I\u2019m currently learning to speak Japanese. I\u2019m open to relocating to meet a partners preferences, but I do own a three bedroom house with no mortgage, so that may be an enticing reason to stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an associates degree in graphic design and a bachelors degree in illustration. I do freelance art and design but the majority of my income is passive and comes from investments and dividends. I have no debt whatsoever, student loans are long ago paid off, I am financially self sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuge fan of fine art, live theater, art museums, particularly impressionist and post impressionist art, love animation and comics, superhero movies, science fiction, dolphins, K Pop, EDM, Pop music, plushies, weight lifting, daily cardio, retro video games, and tabletop gaming (board games, card games, and RPG\u2019s). I\u2019m a certified Pokemon Professor for TPCi, meaning I judge and organize tournaments for the Pokemon TCG.\r\n\r\n\r\nCareer wise I worked for the Michigan Democratic Party off and on for a number of years. I lean left/progressive politically and liberal (in the American usage of the word) but am personally/socially conservative. Essentially I believe people should be able to lead whatever lives they wish but I am personally traditional. I do not smoke, drink, or use any drugs and am looking for a woman who is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter working for the MDP, I also worked at what was the oldest continuously printed newspaper in Michigan. That unfortunately is no longer the case since print media is dying. After that stint my mother got extremely sick to the point she could no longer do basic necessities for herself and needed a full time caregiver. It was the most stressful and difficult job I can imagine someone doing, but I\u2019m glad I was there for her.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m an ardent supporter of many progressive causes but my experiences have lead me to be a primarily a strong advocate for disability rights, animal rights, and environmental protections. Giving a voice to the most vulnerable is my philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n2024 was a big year for me. I went to Toronto Comic Con, Orlando Florida for four days at Disney, one at Universal, and one day at Kennedy Space Center, I also bought tickets to go to Japan in spring of 2025. I\u2019m going to be in Tokyo for two weeks, Osaka for a week, and Kyoto for a week, with day trips to Yokohama and Fukui. Looking for someone who loves travel and preferably nerdy things.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now I\u2019m looking for a life partner. An equal who I can spend the rest of my life with. My mother passed away a little over two years ago. She was the last family I had left. I would prefer to start a family but I also like the idea of traveling the world a bit before that.\r\n\r\n\r\n*   \r\n\r\nHow to get ahold of me:\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/rocco.bertucci?igsh=aG82a3NqYWNtN3Uw&utm_source=qr\r\n\r\n\r\ne-mail: raber60@hotmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/share/9BCsQBhRRkfqBEGW/?",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate Me | Puja Gandhi (last updated 12/2023)\r\n\r\n\r\nHi There!\r\n \r\nI\u2019m looking for a life partner, and decided to make this longer-style profile as a means to better articulate who I am, what I\u2019m looking for, and maybe I find my human along the way \ud83e\udd1e\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR: Fairly traditional, 37 y/o female (5\u2019 2\u201d) looking for someone who is kind, family-oriented, prioritizes being outdoors/being active, who strives for balance in life while also being somewhat ambitious. I was born and raised in the US and am a US citizen. \r\n\r\nYou can find more photos of me and my highlight reel on my instagram (I\u2019m an infrequent user)\r\n\r\n\r\nMe\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a Texas Native currently \u2018living\u2019 in Seattle, Wa. I say \u2018living\u2019 because my mailing address and company I work for is based in Seattle, but I also live/work remotely from other locations. I\u2019m a bit of a minimalist in the sense that I live out of a carry-on and checked bag for the most part and keep my other things (think ski gear/tents/sleeping bag/etc) in storage. I have been living in short term rentals post-pandemic and I like the flexibility and cost-savings this lifestyle provides (for now, not forever). \r\n\r\n\r\nAs for education/career; I have a Master\u2019s degree in Analytical Chemistry (proud PhD dropout), and I no longer do anything chemistry related \u2013 I now work as a product/program manager for a remittance payments company. The work is meaningful to me and pays me enough to live a comfortable lifestyle that is flexible without an excessive amount of stress. I suppose you could say I \u2018designed\u2019 my career path to be this way (you can see about the unconventional path I took on my linkedin). I\u2019d eventually love to have children, and I\u2019d like to be a present/active mother, so I chose this career path to allow me more time to care for those close to me whom I love. \r\n\r\n\r\nOutside of work, I have so. many. hobbies. In the winters, I teach skiing at a local ski resort outside of Seattle. I don\u2019t mean the \u2018cool\u2019 downhill skiing, but I\u2019m talking about dorky Nordic, cross-country skiing. I love being outside, in nature, in the snow with friends and sharing my love of the outdoors with children. I also volunteer with Outdoors for all and teach skiing through that program as well. In the fairer seasons, you\u2019ll find me backpacking, hiking, and cycling. Prior to the pandemic, I purchased a Specialized Ruby Road bike, and have logged over 10K miles on it since then. I love road cycling, but would also love to dive into trying out a gravel-style bike as well!\r\n\r\n\r\nI love being outdoors, but I can also chill. When I\u2019m having a weekend indoors, you\u2019ll find me curled up with a cup of tea knitting sweaters, or taking on a design/woodworking project. One of my dreams is to have a woodworking shop, and to build a sauna in my backyard! \r\nSimple times spent cooking with friends/family, sharing new experiences with others, or enjoying a sunrise/sunset with others are what make me happiest. I have a website that I last updated in 2022 that can tell you a bit more if you\u2019re curious. \r\n\r\n\r\nWho you are:\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who is excited about finding a monogamous long term relationship leading to marriage/kids. You are family-oriented. \r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone who loves the outdoors and travel\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are intentional, sincere, and ready for a long term relationship\r\n\r\n\r\nAre open to living in a place where being surrounded by nature and outdoor activity is accessible and part of daily life\r\n\r\n\r\nYou love to challenge yourself and try new things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a vegetarian and have a strong preference for folks who are plant-based. If you are a carnivore or eat meat daily, this won\u2019t work. \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d really like to have biological children of my own with someone who wishes to be a present parent.  If having children isn\u2019t your jam, this isn\u2019t going to be a fit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill intrigued/think this is a fit?\r\n\r\n\r\nSend me a message at gandhi.pj@gmail.com, I\u2019d love to connect!",

Not interested in any romantic encounters. Looking for long-distance friendship in which we exchange long well-written e-mails in English and/or Russian about our subjective life experiences and how they relate to the world around us. My default mode in life is gawking, wide-eyed, at the insanity of the world around me and quietly muttering \"What the actual bloody fuck?..\" under my breath, and then trying to learn more about evolutionary biology to understand why on earth humans do these things they do. Poetry and logic both please. I want to connect with an actual human who is not hiding behind a wall of trite pleasantness and socially acceptable conversation topics. I want to talk about the meaning of life, existential dread, public policy, thermodynamics,  gyoza, your dog, shit we're going through rn and things like that. It doesn't always have to be profound; I will likely express a lot of banalities because sometimes banalities resonate. I love women, especially gay women, but you can be any age, gender and sexuality - if we click, we click. If we don't, at least we tried. I am weird and I don't click with a lot of people, so if we do click, it'll be a pleasant surprise.\nAbout me: fairly intelligent and nerdy in the sense of being academically oriented but not into typical nerd culture. Also I know as close to zero pop culture as literally anyone I've ever met. I likely have some  annoying combo of ASD, ADHD, GAD, depression and who knows what else but none of it is formally diagnosed and I have accumulated a heap of coping mechanisms; none are too effective but combined they allow to live a life that appears mostly normal from the outside. This is just so you're not surprised at my being one odd bird; otoh, this is Scott's blog, so you likely won't be to begin with.\ntkachira at gmx dot com\nExpand full comment\nReply\nShare\n\u00a9 2025 Scott Alexander\nPrivacy\n\u2219\nTerms\n\u2219\nCollection notice\nStart Writing\nGet the app\nSubstack\nis the home for great culture\nShare\nCopy link\nFacebook\nEmail\nNotes\nMore\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHi there! I\u2019m Tejas. I\u2019m not very familiar with \u201cdate-me\u201d docs, and haven\u2019t read too many of them, but I thought I\u2019d write a brief one. I only recently decided to start looking for a relationship, and thought this was a reasonable place to start!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019d be potentially interested at all, please feel free to shoot me an email (you can reach me at tejassubramaniam@gmail.com) or contact me via Facebook Messenger. Feel free to tell me a bit about yourself, but even just expressing possible interest works!\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\n\r\n\r\n* I\u2019m 22, and currently an undergraduate student at Stanford (studying economics). \r\n* For some simple demographics, I\u2019m South Asian, male, and a lacto-vegetarian. I\u2019m also bi and gray-ace/demisexual. Politically, I\u2019m centrist, or slightly left-of-center. I\u2019m an atheist. \r\n* I\u2019m broadly an effective altruist. I\u2019ve been torn about this label before. I\u2019m not too certain about my future plans; I think I will probably apply to masters programs, and then try to work at a research role at an EA org. I have fairly broad interests, so I could see myself working on animal welfare, AI policy/governance, or economic development. \r\n* I\u2019m a bit introverted, although I\u2019m working on being more social. In my spare time, I like reading nonfiction (and blog posts), playing chess online, and participating in competitive British Parliamentary debate (which is an activity I\u2019ve enjoyed a ton). \r\n* I\u2019m very intellectually curious and eager to learn things: I love having long conversations with people about random things I can learn a ton about, including things I know very little about. \r\n* I\u2019m very neat and organized (although I don\u2019t expect that from a partner necessarily). I\u2019m good at replying to texts and emails promptly. When I\u2019m especially interested in a project, I can be quite hardworking, but otherwise my work ethic is poorer than I\u2019d like (this is something I\u2019m working on myself). I don\u2019t have excellent emotional intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for a long-term relationship, but would also love to go on a few dates. I\u2019m open to dating people of any gender. I\u2019d also be open to either monogamy or poly; I have no strong preference on this matter, and would be flexible according to my partner\u2019s preferences. \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019d especially value a partner who is interested in making the world a better place, interested in any one of economics/math/political science/statistics, nerdy, and loves long conversations about particular curiosities of theirs. Bonus points if we share hobbies (e.g., debate, playing online chess). I\u2019d also love to share some of our values (either on our political views or on effective altruism \u2013 not necessarily both!), but this is not a dealbreaker. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my preferences\r\n\r\n\r\n* I have a low sex drive, and don\u2019t experience a lot of sexual attraction. \r\n* I think it\u2019s unlikely that I will want kids.\r\n* I\u2019m fairly comfortable with long-distance, and I\u2019d be happy to meet/go on a date virtually. But I\u2019d love to meet in-person too. \r\n* I\u2019d want to date someone over 19 but under 30. \r\n\r\n\r\nPictures of me (descriptions below each picture)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m on the left, and that\u2019s my uncle on the right. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStanding in front of a bookstore. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking at a debate tournament.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffSindhu\u2019s Dating Bio\r\nLast Updated: May 5, 2024 \r\nQuick facts\r\n\r\n\r\n* Name: Sindhu\r\n* Age: 36\r\n* Height: 5\u20193\u201d\r\n* Occupation: Software Engineer (Machine Learning) at Meta. \r\n* Location: London, UK. Inflexible for a year-ish, Can consider few European countries after that.\r\n* Build: Used to be obese and have started taking health seriously recently (Moved from obese to overweight zone before setting this doc up). I plan on getting (and staying) in shape - mostly just to be healthy. Will almost certainly still be overweight if you are meeting me in the upcoming  few months, and dates will have to be worked around my gym schedule, fasting zones, and of course work. Sorry. Priorities!\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\t* Looking for: Men/Women, and a long-term relationship. I\u2019m monogamous. I would also want someone monogamous. \r\n* Disclaimer: Have a skin graft and an almost fully (but not fully) functioning limb. Has been a deal breaker in the past for a few dates and a couple of short-term relationships (No judgements. We all have our list for someone we want to see multiple times of the day). So getting it out of the way, in case it\u2019s off-putting. It\u2019s a fun tea-time story for me. It needn\u2019t necessarily be so for you. Totally get it.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nFactoids\r\n* Introverted and not great at initiating conversations. But happy to contribute to deep and/or interesting conversations of any format. \r\n   * Unbelievably bad at small talk (Not proud of this. Small talk also has its place and requires some skill)\r\n* My attachment style is fairly secure. It used to be avoidant a few years ago.\r\n* Beach and water-activities person. Love a good hike with great views. But between the beach and the mountain, long barefoot beach-walks anyday, anytime.\r\n* Dry humour. Love witty responses and may duel you in a wit-athon.\r\n* Kids are not one of my top priorities right now. But with an equal partner with decent parenting capabilities, I am open to having or adopting kids. \r\n* I am a private person and also a privacy nutcase. Reticent about sharing selfies or anything on social media, this bio, and my contact details, for starters. \r\n* In case you haven\u2019t figured out from this list, I have no sense of order.\r\n* Speak 5 languages (English, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam) and want to pick up more. Weirdly into linguistics and how they affect cultures and thoughts (or vice-versa) for some reason.\r\n* Not religious. I was raised a Hindu and to some extent, have some old religious little habits which simply refuse to die. Won\u2019t challenge or question your religious beliefs. Please don\u2019t impose your views on this topic on me. \r\n* Sexuality: While I am sex-positive, I grew up in a regressive environment (My parents and immediate family are sweet, though conservative. It is really more of an India in the 2000s thing). So it will take me a while to open up about my own sex and sexuality. You do you! \r\n* INTP if it matters to you. But I strongly believe people are more nuanced than 16 different varieties. Same goes to zodiac (Aquarius) and other personality traits tests. Also people change. \r\n* My dominant inner voice is cynical about everything (including myself). But with years of practice, I have been somewhat successful in cultivating a second voice that gives everything the benefit of doubt. They both consistently fight, while I chill indecisively.\r\n* Since a near-death experience ~10 years ago - which resulted in the skin graft mentioned in the disclaimer - I have been a strong believer of \u201cthe gut feeling\u201d. \r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: I wrote this entire doc assuming I am talking to my friends or acquaintances I\u2019ve warmed up to. The person you meet or talk to, the first few times, might very well be a dull dud. But I hope we warm up sooner.\r\nPics\r\nNot much of a poser. Don\u2019t photograph well either. But here goes\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe take a look at this first? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPEoC6PNlWo        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n Mandatory Hey-I-socialize pic! \r\n\r\nMandatory Hey-I-socialize pics. But I do so in spurts. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n                       Touristy pics for the sake of it        \r\n  \r\n\r\nYes. Yes. I travel! \r\n\r\n\r\nContent Consumption Starter Kit\r\nSkip this section if you have your own preferred conversation starters. (TLDR: Will watch anything with subtitles. Will listen to anything catchy. Can read anything that piques my interest. They all vary from time to time)\r\nMovies & Shows\r\nWill watch any genre and any language with subtitles. This is my go-to international movie list, and I will generally watch anything rated by Roger Ebert as 3+. If you have a recommendation of a similar movie critic who is alive, please share. Personal favourites from this list are Spirited Away, Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, Narayama Bushiko. \r\n\r\n\r\nI also have a lot of regional favourites that you probably haven\u2019t heard about.\r\nMusic\r\nIn tandem with my movie taste, anything goes for music, as long as it strikes a chord. Generally love jazz, pop, and rap genres and indie music. I like to listen to western classical music when I am doing boring chores (Think documentation at work, or cleaning the house). Sucker for old songs (Chuck Berry, Beatles, ABBA, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Carpenters, and so on). Love new ones equally. \u201cBad Idea right\u201d, \u201cLevitating\u201d, and \u201cBeliever\u201d have been in a loop for a while now. \r\n\r\n\r\nIndian music (both classical, and pop-culturish ones) is a staple part of my childhood and you may hear me pelting out those from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCannot sing. Please don\u2019t ask. May sing/hum absent-mindedly. Please feel free to ask me to shut up. Will not shut up only when I am singing shouting Bohemian Rhapsody. But I want to learn to play an instrument someday - preferably the violin. Haven\u2019t made time for it yet.\r\nBooks\r\nThis one is limited by time. While not an exhaustive list, I read stuff about\r\n* Neuroscience (By no means an expert)\r\n* Linguistics\r\n* Comics (Recent fad. But so far, liking it)\r\n* My book list from the past. Not much has changed in terms of taste, except that I don\u2019t have much time to read anymore. Carving some time out for the past 3 months or so. \r\nWhy a dating bio?\r\nFor an embarrassingly large part of my adult life,  work has taken most or all my time. I have only recently (about a year) discovered the joy of setting boundaries at work, and having a personal life. I have a fairly decent social circle with a close group of friends and have been happy with my circle so far. I took a stab at dating apps for a few months, and found them a lot less fun and a lot more impersonal than they used to be. Hence this old-school bio.\r\nAbout you\r\nI think most of these - wherever applicable - are two way streets. I generally prefer that you fit into most of these categories, in no particular order:\r\n1. Non-smoker (This one is non-negotiable)\r\n2. Not loud and temperamental in frequent doses (I generally don\u2019t like cacophony and prefer consistency and stability in all aspects of life including my partner's emotions)\r\n3. Empathetic and open to diverse perspectives.\r\n4. Age: 30-40 (more of a general preference. Not a must)\r\n5. You are either witty or can convince me that wit and a good sense of humour are not necessary for a healthy, long-term relationship. \r\n6. Have an interest or curiosity in a range of things, and also have a broad interest or opinion on what I do for work. \r\n7. Must help me find my missing spectacles for the 17496th time without sulking. Ok! With a little bit of sulking, after the first 100 times! \r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond this, I think love and/or attraction are simply strong foundations to mutual-respect and trust. Long term relationships sustain on the latter, and hence a bit of self-esteem and integrity on both our parts can be good starters.  And as long as we enjoy each other\u2019s company in the short term and can manage to be good friends in the long term (I think this is a foundation for a good committed relationship) anything goes.\r\nContact details\r\nsindhu_pro@proton.me \r\n\r\n\r\nI have no idea why this took 5 pages long (excluding the pictures), but hopefully this isn\u2019t too rosy or full of platitudes. That was certainly not the intention.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffA bit about me: I'm 33 years old, 6'3\", living in NYC (and a third-generation New Yorker). I work as an engineer at Meta on Reels and I love what I do! I'm kind, happy, curious, creative, and a major nerd. My aunt is certain that I'm \"quite a catch.\"\r\nA bit about who I'm looking for: I'm currently looking for a serious relationship with a woman who is at least not closed to the prospect of marriage and children at some point in their life (with the right person, of course). Ideally someone who can pivot seamlessly between silly and serious conversation, and who is a little weird but still normal enough to charm my parents.\r\nI think I relate best to people who are some kind of engineer/scientist/nerd, but who also have a keen interest in the humanities and are generally well-rounded.\r\nFitness and health: I go on a short run most days and do some gym exercise around every other day. That said, I'm much more likely to want to talk about the podcast I was listening to while exercising than the exercise itself. I drink, but only if someone else at the table already ordered a drink. I don't smoke or use any drugs but I support decriminalization.\r\nReligion: Although I'm generally very secular (and so is my family), my cultural heritage is Jewish and I consider it a part of my identity. I love my family's holiday traditions - including Jewish Christmas (the classic movie and Chinese food) - it's as real of a holiday as Christian Christmas!\r\nFavorite day trip: Take the train to Pelham Bay Park and work up an appetite by walking to Johnny's Reef on City Island, then spend a few hours indulging in their incredibly reasonably priced seafood.\r\nFavorite evening activity: Finding an unusual off-Broadway show and convincing my friends to go (half the fun is the post-show debrief to figure out what we just experienced).\r\nMost surreal childhood memory: Eating at Mars 2112 - an immersive Mars-themed restaurant set up to look like it was carved out of red rock! It had everything - people in alien costumes, a spaceship ride, and above-average chicken fingers. It was emblematic of the kind of early 2000s decadence that we may never see again.\r\nTV triumph that I most often think about: The series finale of Nathan for You.\r\nTV disappointment that I most often think about: The series finale of Lost.\r\nTop podcasts: Normal Gossip, Maintenance Phase, Criminal, You're Wrong About, 5-4, Serious Trouble.\r\nIf money were not a concern: When I first got into programming in high school it was because I wanted to make games, but it turns out that the game industry is horrible and abusive and pays terribly, so I'd much rather be ensconced in a cushy tech job\u2026 anyway all of that is to say that if I didn't have to worry about money then I'd totally start my own game studio (that pays people well and is not abusive).\r\nRelationship to games: I wish there was a word to describe someone who likes video games but whose life isn't spiraling out of control due to a video game addiction. In any case\u2026 that's me! I love games, and I love in particular thinking about what makes them tick. I prefer a broad mix of games and usually don't stick with one for long. Some of my favorites are Baba is You, Breath of the Wild, Oxygen Not Included, Disco Elysium, Inscription, Tunic, and Kentucky Route Zero.\r\n\"He sounds great but is he a crypto/NFT guy?\": Lol no.\r\n\"He sounds great but is he a fan of Joe Rogan or Andrew Tate or Elon Musk? Or is he some other kind of right-wing sicko?\": Absolutely not!\r\nContacts: hello.there.msh@gmail.com",

I\u2019m a Christian currently in a PCA church and sharing faith with a partner is important to me. I\u2019m an optometrist and my favorite part of my job is building relationships with my patients over time (in addition to removing foreign bodies from eyes- that\u2019s my actual fave).

    ProfileText: "\ufeffGod help me I\u2019m making a date me doc  \r\nAbout me\r\nHello! I\u2019m Lawrence. Here you\u2019ll find some basics about me, what I\u2019m looking for in a relationship, and some of my writing and photos.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasics:\r\n* I'm a 28-year-old straight cis man and 6\u20193\u201d. \r\n* I live in Berkeley, CA, but I\u2019m not super attached to the Bay Area and I like traveling.\r\n* Looking for a long- or medium-term relationship, open to dating both trans and cis women. \r\n* I don\u2019t know if I want kids. \r\n* I\u2019m open to both polyamorous and monogamous relationships. \r\nWhat my friends say about me\r\n\u201cLawrence is pretty emotionally mature and insightful in a bunch of ways, and is happy to talk about feelings. [..] I think he might be the best person I know for helping people get over lack of intellectual self-confidence and problems with being intimidated by technical content. [..] He holds himself to very high standards, in a way that can sometimes hurt him but is also often very positive \u2013 he\u2019s extremely receptive to feedback and is very non-defensive even when he\u2019s upset. I think he\u2019d be a good match for someone who wants their relationship to be a big source of growth and improvement, but also of security and unconditional affection.\u201d \r\n\u2013 Beth Barnes\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMan Lawrence, if you have romantic struggles, then there's no hope for the rest of us.\u201d  \r\n\u2013 Nat Kozak\r\nMore about me \r\nI often feel intense emotions. I sometimes stop while walking or driving to just take in the view and reflect on how good things are. I get excited about clever ideas and am deeply touched by acts of kindness. I feel on a deep level that most people are very good and are trying their best, and it makes me really sad when they fail or have a rough time. I feel very upset when people are unreasonable, and I often feel a strong desire to fix problems I see around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a pretty good memory. Both for dates and conversations, and for lots of random facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m eager to pick up my partner\u2019s interests. In the past, I\u2019ve enjoyed ballroom dancing, traveling, hiking, cooking together, stargazing, and visiting museums and exhibits. I enjoy talking about machine learning, economics, history, psychology, and random animal facts.\r\n  \r\n\r\nI have a dog. His name is Benji, and he\u2019s a good boy (not really, but he is a very adorable one). \r\n\r\n\r\nI care deeply about doing good. I want to make both the world around me and the world in general a better place. I\u2019ll stand up for what I think is right, and try to keep promises and be fair to people. (Also, sometimes I stay up all night to help others finish their projects and meet their deadlines.)\r\nWho I tend to get along with\r\nSincerity and kindness: I like people who say true things, genuinely relate to others, and aren\u2019t afraid to wear their heart on their sleeve. I like people who do nice things for others from the depths of their hearts. Also, I think it\u2019s fine to take lots of time and be very gentle when you do it, but I think it\u2019s very important to be able to face hard truths about yourself or the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual curiosity: I like having conversations with a partner where I feel like one or more of us are learning something, or I can share in their enthusiasm and knowledge about a subject. \r\n\r\n\r\nHigh standards: I like people who have high standards both for themselves and for the people around them. If you play video games all day, I hope you\u2019re at least good at video games. \ud83d\ude1b\r\nPossible sources of incompatibility\r\nI can be quite negative. When I\u2019m sad, I often feel like nothing is working; when I fail, I can be quite harsh with myself. I also tend to be lower valence in general, but I\u2019m working on being gentler and happier. I sometimes express true but unkind opinions about others. \r\n\r\n\r\nI work a lot. I think it\u2019s important to be working on productive things, so I tend to be a bit of a homebody by default and I\u2019m not likely to spontaneously develop new hobbies. However, I think that spending time with my partner would definitely count as productive time and I\u2019m happy to spend a lot of time with you!\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t drink or do drugs. I feel comfortable hanging out with people who drink, though I would feel uncomfortable about frequent heavy drinking. I\u2019m also fine with psychedelics as long as you don\u2019t take them in the presence of charismatic cult leaders. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am pretty attached to my dog. If you\u2019re allergic to dogs, this will be a problem. Sorry. \r\n________________\r\nOther Pictures\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nContact Info\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in chatting more or think we\u2019re compatible, please email me at lawrencechan96@gmail.com. \r\n________________\r\nAppendix\r\nSome things I believe about dating docs and dating:\r\nDating docs aren\u2019t (just) for finding dates. I think a significant fraction of the value of dating docs comes from the process of writing; another large fraction comes from communicating information with future partners that might not come up naturally in the first few dates. I\u2019m also not super convinced that dating docs work well for finding new people to date, compared to e.g. asking people out in person. So this doc errs on the side of being more informative as opposed to promotional. \r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional and social intelligence are real and important. There are many skills in actually making relationships work, both in terms of knowing yourself and in terms of knowing how to relate to others. While I can be a fan of numbers and spreadsheets, it\u2019s important to be in touch with who you are and what you want, and also who your partner is and what they want. Also, communication is important! \r\n\r\n\r\nShared interests are significantly less important than shared values and shared desire to make a relationship work. I think dating apps and docs tend to focus too much on screening for shared interests or experiences, which I think can easily be developed over time. (In particular, I\u2019m happy to pick up your interests! In the past I\u2019ve picked up the interests of previous partners.) On the other hand, deeply held values are probably unlikely to change, and I don\u2019t think romantic relationships work without both parties wanting it to work and putting in the effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost disagreements and issues can be worked through (given shared values and a desire to make the relationship work). I think I have a lot of growth mindset for relationships; I think that many common points of disagreement can be worked on. For example, I think that issues like division of labor (for chores) or different hobbies can generally be solved if both people are willing to try. As a corollary, I think that fights are really bad in romantic relationships; the whole point is to be on the same side, and work toward a mutual goal. Accordingly, I\u2019ve had very few fights in my past romantic relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity is necessary for people to grow in relationships. I personally value relationships that push me to grow and do better, but I don\u2019t think these relationships can be stable without a firm bedrock of security and mutual trust. After all, it\u2019s pretty hard to be ambitious if you feel like a single misstep could cause your partner to leave you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationships can be thought of as trade agreements, but you generally shouldn\u2019t. Relationships are trade agreements (in the sense that every persistent interaction can be thought of as a trade agreement), and this frame can be somewhat helpful. For example, it highlights the fact that relationships should be a positive sum voluntary endeavor, and that both partners should try to provide things that are to their comparative advantage. However, I find that this framing can often cause people to take an adversarial stance toward their partners (i.e. a trade negotiation), or cause people to value tangible, concrete things about their partners over emotional support or vibes, and so don\u2019t think that people should think about relationships this way by default. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional writing samples:\r\nI guess the largest repository my public writing is my LessWrong account: https://www.lesswrong.com/users/lawrencec",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffContestant #2718: Cristian Trout\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n________________\r\n  Basics:\r\n* Male, straight\r\n* 5\u201910\u201d\r\n* 28, looking for someone in the ~26-32 range.\r\n* Seeking primary, long-term partner.\r\n* Preference for monogamy mostly because I\u2019m pretty certain in a polyamorous relationship my attention would be spread too thin for me. However, I\u2019m not into possessive exclusivity (I don\u2019t get jealous and feel slightly uncomfortable with people who easily get jealous).\r\n* Aromantic (but happy to humor those who are into the romantic)\r\n* Sorta demisexual? Behaviourally for sure: in the realm of relationships \u201cI am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires.\u201d It takes me a while to warm up to people, but once I do I\u2019m very loyal and cuddly.\r\n* Mix of intro- and extroverted. Medium-sized social battery? I like meeting new people occasionally, and love hosting or hanging with friends. But after e.g. a fun weekend of full-time social exposure, I need a day or two of quiet to recup.\r\n* Neither prioritizing nor avoiding having children in the future\r\n* Currently in Boston/Oxford but pretty flexible: could move to basically any major city in US or EU. Preference for East Coast of US, France or UK.\r\n* Fluent in English and French (would love it if you are too!)\r\n* Current work: AI policy researcher, artist (screenwriting and videography).\r\n* B.A. and M.A. in Philosophy\r\n* Vegetarian when I\u2019m ordering, flexitarian otherwise. (Would struggle to live as a vegan: cheese is a strong part of my identity. Could be swayed.)\r\n* Not religious\r\n* Non-smoker, glass of wine on occasions\r\nCharacter:\r\nSome sort of cross between French bourgeois, Midwestern son, and ironic Jew. An imposter among all except those who are equally culturally confused. Trained in philosophy, self-taught in everything else. Serious on the outside, goofy on the inside.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinds the unambitious, parochial life to be humble and beautiful. Finds the world too broken, and himself too privileged or hubristic to accept such a life for myself. Grinds and hustles against the hustle and grindset culture. Fascinated with engineering, tinkering, science, but is not a techno-optimist. Finds that small is beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes has \u201cone thought too many,\u201d a character flaw. Speaks mind when probably shouldn\u2019t more often than keeps quiet when probably should speak up. Can be quite direct at times \u2013 avoids sugar-coating things. Sets high expectations for self and others. Sometimes struggles to admit when wrong, but eventually does.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking to share the ride with a life-long friend accomplice! Always striving to live more virtuously :)\r\n\r\n\r\nNB: Friends fear this dating profile is \u201ca bit too much.\u201d To which I respond: \u201cbut that\u2019s very like me!\u201d\r\nSeeking:\r\n* A co-conspirator. I wish to build beautiful things with my partner, at work and at home. I wish to be involved in my partner\u2019s career, and vice versa. I wish our talents and temperaments to complement each other so as to make us a dynamic duo, a force for good :) I\u2019m currently trying hard to help \u201cmake AI go well.\u201d\r\n* Someone who challenges me. Someone well-studied in their craft or a rigorous thinker. An interest in philosophy, economics, or art are pluses! (Trading in truisms and half-baked things quickly bores me.) But also\u2026\r\n* Someone who knows how and when to shove all that braininess to the side and run down a sand dune, pull a silly pose, bask in the moonlight, or cozy up with a warm cuppa.\r\n* Someone who knows Europe and or America: I\u2019m culturally confused enough as it is, and would rather not become more so... (Ideally looking for someone who understands what that\u2019s like, since it\u2019s a key aspect of my identity). I don\u2019t brag my privilege of being well-traveled, and I dislike what I call \u201ccultural tourism\u201d (treating culture like so many colors to embellish one\u2019s instagram feed; taking cultural diversity for granted; failing to care for, own up to, partake in, and embody one\u2019s own culture).\r\n\r\n\r\nSome things I love:\r\n* Cooking for/with friends, hosting dinner parties, board game nights!\r\n* Tinkering: DIY repair, optics, dance, music. Not good at any of these, love experimenting anyway :)\r\n* Hiking, being in nature\r\n* Reading a poem or watching a great film and then doing a deep dive discussion with others! Off-the-cuff sampling of works I love:\r\n   * Rashomon\r\n   * Parasite\r\n   * Lawrence of Arabia\r\n   * East of Eden\r\n   * Le Petit Prince\r\n   * Lord of the Flies\r\n   * Brave New World\r\n   * The Cosmicomics\r\n   * (poems by Robert Frost)\r\n   * Calvin and Hobbes\r\n   * Outer Wilds\r\n* Watching some classic Looney Toons or an old comedy (typically Jerry Lewis or Danny Kaye) with my family \u2764\r\n* Playing some silly couch multi-player games with friends or family (Nintendo boy here!) (\u2229^o^)\u2283\u2501\u2606\r\nHow to proceed:\r\nIf you think you\u2019d like to meet, or chat with, feel free to reach out at ctroutcsi@gmail.com, or here on messenger, or text me at seven eight one, five one eight, eight nine nine six! (I think messenger or text are more reliable, since emails will sometimes go to spam\u2026) If you\u2019d like to learn more about my work/hobbies, feel free to visit www.ctrout.art.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know it can be intimidating to reach out, but of course I made this doc to meet new people, so don\u2019t be shy :)\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Photos      \r\nDid we mention hubris?",

I enjoy running ultra marathons, meditating, reading 4-5 books at once, and swimming in the open ocean. I build satellites that measure climate change at NASA, and run a non-profit that provides housing to homeless students. I have a 6 year old shelter mutt named DJ Wigglebottoms. She likes baby carrots, putting all of her weight on me, and chasing lizards in our yard.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m looking for someone who spends time reading about and practicing healthy communication skills, devotes a large part of their time or funds to a cause they care deeply about, and who wants to start a family someday.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore photos below.

I love having people over for dinner and cooking for them. I\u2019m intolerant to eggs and dairy and often cook vegan although I am not vegan. I also enjoy single origin chocolate.\r\nRunning and Cycling\r\nI consider myself a strong endurance athlete. I\u2019m not currently training for anything specific and just maintaining a casual level of fitness. I will run or cycle 4+ times a week and I really enjoy it. My ideal partner would have to be physically active in some way, not necessarily running or cycling. You get bonus points if you enjoy cycling and running.

I enjoy colorful clothing over black.\r\nDating\r\nLocation\r\nBerlin is my home but I\u2019m open to exploring and trying new cities.\r\nStyle\r\nI\u2019m open to a short term relationship and just cuddling up for the winter or something longer.\r\nYou\r\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, shoot me an email. yewcb0yk@duck.com (anonymized email)\r\nSend me some information about you and a picture or two or your date me doc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nA hiking trip in the Himalayas in Pakistan",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDavid\u2019s Dating profile\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nSummary\r\nI am a disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m an assistant professor working on Bayesian social and formal epistemology, the philosophy of AI, and the foundations of physics. Somehow I have ended up with two PhDs, one in particle physics, and one in the philosophy of science. I am something of a polymath. My Erd\u0151s number is less than or equal to four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am kind, thoughtful and curious. I am excited by, and open to new ideas. I strongly value openness and honesty. I am shy, introverted and almost certainly terribly socially awkward. I am a neurodivergent trainwreck. I am often found at the epicentre of a whirling void of chaos, but this is just by coincidence. Imagine a confused and profusely apologetic teacher running in late to teach their class, and dropping their books everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am vegan, somewhere on the (highly heterodox) left politically, feminist, and very loosely adjacent to (or aligned with?) effective altruism and rationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am (very) British. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very important to realise that I am definitely not \u201cfun\u201d. Don't even *think* about trying to take me on an \u201cadventure\u201d.\r\nInterests\r\nMy interests are rather eclectic. I particularly enjoy discovering new, elegant and holistic ideas that simplify and unify a great many threads: this applies not just in physics, but in every field of human knowledge. A selective summary of some things I often think about might include:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Physics \u2013 especially quantum field theory and particle physics. \r\n* Philosophy \u2013 my specialisms are in formal and social epistemology and the philosophy of science, but let\u2019s face it, every area of philosophy is almost definitionally interesting.\r\n* Rationality and Bayesianism.\r\n* Cognitive science and artificial intelligence \u2013 obviously.\r\n* Why isn\u2019t my code compiling?\r\n* Politics/economics/sociology. \r\n* History.\r\n* Music and music theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, please let me stress this list is non-exhaustive. I am generally very fascinated by other topics as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder at the nature of time, space and the cosmos. I marvel at the mysteries of human history and the patterns exhibited in human societies, minds, biological structures and other complex systems, deconstructing and analysing the various media of human culture. I am particularly fascinated by the problems of epistemology, and other areas of philosophy. How should we interpret quantum field theories? Is it possible that the Universe is deterministic? What does it mean for A to cause B, and does that imply a direction in time? What makes time so different from the dimensions of space? When are two scientific theories equivalent? Is scientific knowledge cumulative? How can we justify the use of Occam's razor in induction? How important is the \"look elsewhere effect\"? Why does anything exist at all? How strong is the anthropic principle? Is a high level of artificial intelligence imminent and what are its implications for society and the economy? Should we aspire to have a society without work? Is it OK to have incommensurable moral values? How culturally contingent is the modern, Western ideal of liberty? Is it possible to improve human happiness or are we stuck on a hedonic treadmill? Also, how can we save the political left in Western Europe in a time of globalisation, secular stagnation, and a resurgent China? Is the Eurozone doomed? How can we save the Labour party from itself? A question possibly more intractable than anything else posed here! When I am out and about, I often think about urban design, public spaces, and architecture too. Or I mull over post-Soviet hauntology. I particularly enjoy discovering new, elegant and holistic ideas that simplify and unify a great many threads: this applies not just in physics, but in every field of human knowledge. There are, I think, few forms of happiness greater than the satisfaction that arises from the creative application of thought to a problem and discovering a brilliant solution. I love being introduced to new ideas, so if you think you know something that would interest me, please do share it!\r\nPersonality\r\n* INTJ-T or INTP-T depending on the test (I treat Myers\u2013Briggs as a convenient summarising tool rather than a highly credible scientific model). \r\n* Presumably Ravenclaw (obviously a much more objective model).\r\n* Neutral Good alignment.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might have noticed I\u2019m quite eccentric. I generally have a very high willingness to deviate from social norms, and I\u2019m usually unphased by weirdness in other people. In some ways, I might take this too far: I instinctively veer away from groupthink, tribalism or veneration/idolization, in a way that probably can make me seem disagreeable. I seem unusually disinclined to naturally align my opinions or attitudes towards those of other people around me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sprinkle a lot of what I say with very subtle and dry humour, which very few people understand or notice. From this, you should probably conclude that I'm actually not very funny.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very open to new ideas, and generally curious. I am very much a high-decoupling thinker, although I see the value of being able to think in a low-decoupling way too. I do enjoy exploring ideas in a way that can sometimes come across as unintentionally controversial or provocative. I can comfortably suppress this, but I think I get on best with people who also enjoy thinking in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am kind, patient and good at listening. I am generally very forgiving of mistakes, and tend not to hold grudges against others.  I highly value kindness and magnanimity in other people. I don\u2019t tend to take differences of opinions personally, and I am very open to criticism. I don\u2019t tend to get angry easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nI strongly value openness and honesty, and I get on best with people who also share these values. I like to build relationships on intimacy and trust.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can dislike people who are very loud, arrogant or domineering. I am generally very sensitive to power-balances between people. I have a streak of culturally puritanical moralism. I like integrity, authenticity, and the calm search for enlightenment. I dislike extravagance, gaudiness, and unjustified grandiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like my life to be zen. I do not tend to get on well with high-drama people. I am a good demonstration of Karl Friston\u2019s Free Energy principle because I try to avoid surprises, both good and bad.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am usually very polite and obliging to the needs of other people. But I mostly prefer it if people are willing to openly assert their needs and desires. I strongly adhere to \u201cask culture\u201d. However, occasionally I can overthink things, in a way to ensure I do not inadvertently pressure or harm other people. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am very ambitious and motivated. People tend to perceive me as something of a workaholic; however, this is only the case with work I passionately enjoy, or am very stressed about. I am a terrible procrastinator at everything else, especially anything involving admin. I can be very strong-willed on certain things; unfortunately motivating myself to do things I find tedious is not one of them. Some people find that I can be very stubborn; like some non-Newtonian fluids, my rigidity can increase under pressure.\r\nPsychology\r\nSometimes I feel like the fated star-child, but then the camera dolly-zooms, and in a dizzying gestalt shift I realise that I am actually a barely-functional human being. It bemuses me that some people find this profile intimidating, because in truth I am usually a chaotic mess, stumbling from one fiasco to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nClearly, I am \u201cneurodivergent\u201d. I think I am autistic (self-diagnosed), I have ADHD (sort-of diagnosed) and I am dyspraxic (actually diagnosed!). The possibility that I might have ADHD only occurred a few years ago (I had a complete misconception of what this was); since then I have been taking vyvanse/elvanse (lisdexamfetamine), which has improved my life incredibly. The only comparable experience I can think of is when I first put on glasses. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this, I am mostly a scatter-brained, highly forgetful disaster. I am naturally fairly incompetent at most basic day-to-day tasks. I do my best, but my best is usually pretty terrible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I probably haven\u2019t mentioned this yet, but I am also highly forgetful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of many types of social interactions, I am pretty spectacularly awkward. I am usually better one-on-one than in groups, but I generally prefer large groups to small groups (more opportunities to hide). I am very introverted, by which I mean I tend to find social interaction very exhausting. This decreases when I grow more comfortable with someone, but usually it is still somewhat tiring. However, I actually really love exploring getting to know interesting people, and I generally do enjoy and value social interaction. I\u2019m just able to do much less of it than some people, and need a lot of time to myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, I think I am actually very good at intuitively understanding and emotionally reading people. This is something that I have never found difficult. However, there are probably some social conventions that I miss or don\u2019t understand. That being said, I don\u2019t think my understanding is all that bad: there are some advantages to viewing things as an outsider, a sort of alien anthropologist. (But of course, I might not know what I don\u2019t know!)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have high levels of anxiety overall. This is very much lower than it used to be, but is probably higher than average. I had OCD as a teenager, and still have some mild OCD tendencies (yes, I am mildly triggered by the poor alignment of the images at the top of this profile). In the past, I have experienced some mental health problems including depression. In recent years, I\u2019ve been remarkably happy and mentally healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the last seven or eight years, I have felt increasingly more alive, and reinvigorated. A lot of my mental health problems have become less severe in one way or another. I have gradually been learning to fall back in love with myself. This has been an extremely romantic process.\r\nPhysicality\r\nPhysically speaking, you could describe me as an organic, self-organising, irreversible, dynamic, non-linear, open, dissipative system, far from thermal equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not what you were looking for? Fine, fine, if you really insist, here are some more \u201csalient\u201d features. I am:\r\n\r\n\r\n* 34 years old\r\n* Anatomically male\r\n* British (obviously)\r\n* Average height (around 175cm, or 5 feet, 9 inches tall)\r\n* Average weight (with a bmi around 23 at the time of writing)\r\n* Presumably not unfit (I am a fast walker, and I run 6 days a week)\r\n* In no way \"in shape\", unless the shape you have in mind is some sort of blobitectural abomination (perhaps a G\u00f6mb\u00f6c?)\r\n* Physically healthy (except for very mild asthma)\r\n* White/caucasian.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have:\r\n* Green-brown eyes\r\n* Disaster hair\r\n* Glasses due to being short-sighted.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can probably infer my approximate appearance from the pictures, some of which were even taken within the last decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship Things\r\nI am genuinely (yes, genuinely) open to forming many kinds of new connections, or just seeing how things evolve. That could include forming friendships, relationships, or other things. However, I would prefer to meet people without strong expectations or assumptions about a relationship escalator.\r\n\r\n\r\nI quite like the polyamory model, and my prior experience with it has generally been successful.  I would be open to various relationship models ranging from monogamy to relationship anarchy, with the right person or people. I see pros and cons of different models. Overall, this is something I am more pragmatic about than ideological, and in general I am fairly flexible. One partner said (perhaps accurately) that I was too much of a relationship anarchist to ever identify as one.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B. I do have some ongoing entanglements, so I may not be compatible with very strict forms of monogamy. I am open to looser forms of monogamy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, regardless of the particular model, I try to form relationships on as rational a basis as possible, allowing a particular arrangement to develop naturally between individuals. I very much tend to view each friendship/relationship on its own terms, which means that they often don't fit easily into socially-established categories. Genuine communication is essential. Again, I take openness and honesty as very fundamental prerequisites for being able to interact with other people in the most positive possible way.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tend to dislike \u201cnew relationship energy\u201d, and don\u2019t experience this as strongly as some people seem to. I experience very little immediate attraction to people, rather this grows gradually as a relationship develops and we build a connection. I can be quite romantic and value intimacy very highly once I become close to someone. However, for me, I find that romantic feelings are mutually, consciously cultivated; I never really \u201cfall\u201d for people spontaneously. I like relationships to evolve slowly, and grow stronger over time. \r\n\r\n\r\nI find physical intimacy to be an important and valuable feature of relationships. That does not have to be sexual (I have had successful and happy relationships with asexual people). I find sexual activity to be a highly unique experience with every person; it is something I prefer to take slowly and gradually evolve. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe gender of a partner is not an important component in degree of attraction towards them. In that sense, I am happy to identify as \u201cbisexual\u201d or \u201cpansexual\u201d or \u201cqueer\u201d, whichever is most conducive to good vibes or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nI dislike uneven power dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen my relationships, career, finances, social setting etc are all in good shape, I would certainly consider having children with a suitable partner or partners. \r\nIdeologies and Identities\r\nI am generally fairly anti-tribalist, and don\u2019t easily fully align with any groups. I tend to adopt far too many heretical views. Nonetheless, I\u2019ll do my best to situate myself within the broad ideological contours of the contemporary moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find politics interesting, and appreciate the importance of both policy and realpolitik. Overall, I broadly lie on the pluralist, progressive left, although this varies quite considerably, depending on contexts and issues. Economically, I sit somewhere between radical social democracy and market-oriented democratic socialism. Constitutionally and socially, I am very much a liberal, or perhaps more accurately I increasingly identify with classical civic republicanism. However, my views on particular policies and parties can be surprising; I instinctively avoid tribalism and political dogma, and try to borrow widely from a range of ideas. I am generally cautious of overarching grand narratives or overly simple ideological frameworks. I have some sympathy towards radical aims, but try to be pragmatic in my views on how to achieve them. I think democracy, liberty, equality, and constitutionalism are all good ideas, and many of the most interesting questions are about the best way to reconcile them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of political parties, I currently most closely align with the soft left of the Labour party in the U.K., though I\u2019m rather hard to classify. Apparently (contrary to my claims in the previous section) I have some repressed masochistic inclinations because I\u2019m still a Labour party member.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very much a feminist, mostly influenced by some ad hoc mixture of radical and intersectional ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a culture wars irenicist, in that I think the culture war itself is bad and harmful. However, I am exasperated by both sides of these battles. Overall, my views are idiosyncratically radically progressive, but in some ways also quite culturally conservative.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very much a philosopher in every sense of the word (although please be very careful, because I am mildly allergic to metaphysics). Insofar as I have a philosophical project, it draws from the traditions of logical empiricism, subjective Bayesianism and Skyrmsian naturalism. And of course, I am very dedicated to physics (although our facebook relationship status is currently set to \u201cit's complicated\u201d). I still lean towards some sort of hidden variables approach to quantum mechanics (in spite of my scientific anti-realism). I do see the appeal of an Everettian interpretation, but I have some deep, unresolved doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEthically, I have some sympathies with a utilitarian stance, but I may not be purely utilitarian. Decision theoretically, my views are not very settled, although I am not a naive causal decision theorist. Worryingly, I am not fully decided about whether that pushes me towards a sophisticated evidential decision theory, or some form of timeless decision theory. Either way, that means that my practical ethics looks a lot more deontological in practice than some utilitarians: I will cooperate in a twin prisoner\u2019s dilemma!\r\n\r\n\r\nI am ontologically atheist, tropologically spiritual and theologically noncognitivist.\r\n\r\n\r\nI broadly align with the fundamentals of the rationalist, post-rationalist and effective altruist approaches. They are fonts of absolutely incredible ideas. That being said, I harbour quite severe doubts about the epistemic and social health of the movements themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\nLists of Things\r\n(The purpose of these lists is to give a flavour. They're not intended to be exhaustive!)\r\nLiterature\r\nContemporary:\r\nMargaret Atwood; Hilary Mantel; Kazuo Ishiguro; Jorge Luis Borges; Ian McEwan; Haruki Murakami; Umberto Eco; Graham Greene; John le Carr\u00e9.\r\nClassical:\r\nFyodor Dostoyevsky; George Eliot; Thomas Hardy; Jane Austen.\r\nMultigenerational civilizational fantasy and science fiction epics:\r\nThe Hainish Cycle; the Foundation series; A Canticle for Leibowitz; the Dune Series; A Song of Ice and Fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time, ADHD made me a very slow reader. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t enjoy reading, but that I found it overly-exciting, and my mind would keep wandering off, stimulated by the ideas. In recent years, medication, audio books, and better mastery of my symptoms have helped a great deal, and I\u2019ve started consuming a lot more. But this means there are many gaps that I would like to fill.\r\nNonfiction\r\nGodel, Escher, Bach; The Selfish Gene; Thinking Fast and Slow; Capital in the 21st Century; Seeing Like a State; Mathematical Games by Martin Gardner; Physics textbooks by David Griffiths, James Binney or James Blundel.\r\nMusic\r\nClassical\r\nMozart; Beethoven; Bach; Sibelius; Jan\u00e1\u010dek; Tchaikovsky; Bruckner; Mahler; Wagner (yes); Howells; Mendelssohn; Schubert; Prokofiev; Rachmaninov; Rimsky-Korsakov; Dvorak; Khachaturian; Byrd; Tallis; P\u00e4rt; Poulenc; Pergolesi.\r\nSymphonic/Power/Folk Metal\r\nNightwish; Turisas; Sabaton; Blind Guardian; Helion Prime; Dragonforce.\r\nMiscellanea\r\nA lot of jazz and related genres: Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis. Sometimes I become temporarily fascinated by other particular genres of music: classical Hindustani ragas, maqam, klezmer, isochronic tones, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to play clarinet, violin and trumpet, and I did choral singing for a while. To my eternal shame, I haven\u2019t kept up with these. But music remains extremely important to me, somewhere close to my soul.\r\nVideo Games\r\nI play Age of Empires II online regularly with a group of friends (Elo ~ 1400 #humblebrag). Other games I enjoy or have enjoyed include:\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropa Universalis, Crusader Kings, Victoria; the Civilization Series; Cities Skylines; Rimworld; Factorio; Open TTD; Disco Elysium; Pentiment; the Baldur\u2019s Gate series; Planescape Torment; Monkey Island; Grim Fandango; Chrono Trigger.\r\n\r\n\r\nI tend to go through long periods of not playing any games. But when my mental reserves run to zero, sometimes some part of my brain rebels, and I become fixated on a game for a little while, before I recover.\r\nFilms\r\nI don\u2019t watch many. Some that I enjoy include: \r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Beauty; anything by Hayao Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli; Pan's Labyrinth; Schindler's List.\r\nBroadcast media\r\nI don\u2019t consume very much broadcast media.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarl Sagan's Cosmos; documentaries by Adam Curtis; Bryan Magee's wonderful interviews; most things on BBC Radio 4.\r\nYoutube Channels\r\n3Blue1Brown; PBS Spacetime; Kurzgesagt; CGP Grey; Maiorianus; Voices of the Past.\r\nBlogs\r\nAzimuth; Astral Codex Ten; A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry; Stumbling and Mumbling; Mainly Macro; Noapinion; Shtetl-Optimized; whatever Wolfram is doing; Chartbook; Age of Invention; Scientific Discovery.\r\nFood\r\nI am almost entirely vegan and strictly vegetarian. Beyond that, I am fairly flexible. Some of my favourite foods include:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Chocolate.\r\nA Perfect Day\r\nIn the golden light of the dawn, I head to the gymnasium, its tall, firm Corinthian columns silhouetted against the morning sun. I debate with the other great philosophers as we watch the naked male youths wrestle in the palaestra. Their lithe forms glisten with perspiration, as they dance in tandem, mind and body in exquisite harmony. With the day's exertion done, I wander back to my oikos, where I am hosting a symposium, with all the foremost intelligentsia of the polis. We discuss the great unsolved mysteries of life, the Universe and everything, tiring away the sun with our talk. Finally, with our rhytons drained, the guests wander out into the evening's lengthening shadows.

And you want to get in touch? Are you sure about that?\r\n\r\n\r\n* \u201cYes, now give me the contact details!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you would like to be friends or date, or something related, you can email me at:\r\ndafidius [AT] gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like receiving messages from people. (Even if I don\u2019t reply, I genuinely promise that I almost certainly enjoyed receiving your message! I have never received a response to this profile that I didn\u2019t enjoy reading.) I\u2019m very shy so you should probably message me first. But if you really don\u2019t know what to write, you could just send a link to your own dating profile, thereby putting the onus on me.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find my manifold.love profile here.\r\nYou can also find my OKCupid profile here.\r\nAll my dating profiles (including this catastrophe of a date-me page) should be regarded as being \u201cunder construction\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish, you can add me as a friend on facebook here, although I don\u2019t use the site very actively.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, if you really want, you can see my academic website here. However, if possible, try not to send dating messages to my academic email addresses! [Warning: very out of date. I really need to update it, but I hate doing so.]\r\n\r\n\r\n* \u201cObviously I don\u2019t want to message you! Someone like you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nYou might want to investigate these lists of dating profiles, which have a relatively high density of people I find interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n* \u201cI don\u2019t want to date or even be friends, but I really need you to read my 30,000 page THEORY OF EVERYTHING, explaining why Einstein Was Wrong and the Physics Establishment are suppressing my revolutionary ideas!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe best way to get my attention is to email that to my special email address here. And I promise to get back to you just as soon as I\u2019ve finished reading your theory\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n* \u201cActually, I don\u2019t want to contact you at all\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nProbably a good decision!

    ProfileText: "\ufeffJay Geis\r\nThe Golden Knight\r\nEmail: jjgoldenknight@gmail.com\r\nTwitter: @JayGeisGold\r\nSteam: https://steamcommunity.com/id/ReturnoftheKnight/\r\nMy creed: Nobility, Heroism, Preeminence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people don't have the attention span for a book, so I'll try to keep this comparatively brief; to further assist, paragraphs are organized in order of importance (most important at top). My personality is best described as energetic, enthusiastic, rational, daring, and brave (exactly what you imagine when you think of the word \u201cKNIGHT\u201d). Mom describes me as \u201clively and loud\u201d, and I appreciate someone who is very direct with me. I am a straight white male, 31 years old, with a thin build, and I'm attracted to natural beauty and inner strength, someone who's smart, cute, and tough. Don't lather your body with paints or inks or perfumes or piercings, stay away from smoking and drugs, show me a steadfast determination, and through that you'll have a solid first impression. Fortune favors the bold; be bold.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a reputation for a fighting spirit, with steely resilience against obstacles and an attitude that's quick to ask, \"What do you expect me to DO about it\". My primary interests involve martial arts, hunting, and video games that involve intense violence, meaning my fighting spirit can also be taken more literally; in the correct context, I do enjoy a fight. All themes say I am, figuratively, an absolute hawk, and I very much want someone who compliments that with natural synergy. This means that, so long as I'm by your side, you'll never have to worry about a dark creepy alleyway ever again (unless you specifically enjoy that sort of situation, in which case I'll accommodate you every step of the way).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's important to me is finding a female partner and equal, not a pet. I do mean that both figuratively (i.e. not submissive or dominant, also not passive) and literally (i.e. I don't like cats, dogs, those kinds of pets). And I need someone who's able and willing to continue my biological legacy, so until genetic engineering becomes real, there's only one way to do that: old-fashioned penis-in-vagina sex. Between that and my hypersexual libido with sexual activity (including masturbation) measured on a daily scale, there's no getting around it: no sex, no partner. There's more to an intimate relationship than sex, but it is an essential element for me. Similarly, the most effective way to show you love me is by touch: hugging, rubbing, cuddling, tickling, and obviously sex are the most notable examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality compatibility is the difference between playmates and partners! I'd be satisfied having simple playmates for casual sex, but I still crave more; I want and need a truly intimate bond. If we end up being able to strike up compelling and thought-provoking conversation more times than not, that's absolutely a good sign. If it can be helped, don't respond with a couple words or a single sentence, try aiming for a paragraph or two. Give me something that'll make me think! And give me something that shows YOU are thinking! Good conversation is like Tennis: there's back-and-forth, each next reply building off the last answer. Ironic since I'm not a fan of the ball sports, but that's beside the point.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as what I fantasize about you as a person, I'm absolutely not picky about your body type or build (skinny, plump, average, Amazonian, or built like a mattress, none of that matters to me), and I'm not even very picky about the skin color (though white is preferred; I am white and do want white kids, but if it can't be helped, then it can't be helped; any legacy's better than nothing). In pure fantasy limited only by imagination, I'm attracted to masochism; I'm a known sadist who enjoys acute physical pain upon a cute female (i.e. biting, stinging, scratching, mild burning sensations, the list covers almost all magnitudes). I don't blame you if that scares you off, but if you get excited from the idea of playacting \"Brave Wilderness: GIRL EDITION\", there will be many racy adventures begging for us to explore!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily mind being a stepdad, just make sure the kid wouldn\u2019t mind having a half-brother or half-sister. That said, right now I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m yet in a position to settle with a family as I\u2019m still living like a teenager and I\u2019m stuck so long as the work-life balance is pending. \r\n\r\n\r\nI think that's enough to get started. There's more to say, but I've been told it's best to leave some mystery left for you to find out. In short, I romanticize the ideal of \u201ctwo halves to a whole\u201d, like I\u2019m seeking my other half. Let me know what you think, because the only wrong answer is [no answer].",

Other places I\u2019ve been living in >3 months: Hong Kong, London.\r\n* Available in English and German (native German but prefer English for dating).\r\n* 173 cm tall. Athletic build.\r\n* Finishing my Master\u2019s in Social Sciences and always busy with side projects/jobs.\r\n* Pretty neurotypical.\r\n* Looking for a committed primary / monogam-ish relationship with a man between 27-36 y/o.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos: 2023 (left & right)\r\n________________\r\nPhotos: 2023 (left), 2024 (middle), 2024 (right)      \r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies, Interests, and details\r\n\r\n\r\n* Community: Having a good community is super important to me and I invest significant time and energy into caring for my network of friends. I like to be proactive in organising and participating in social events, like to experiment with co-living, and learn about other ways to deepen relationships. Wholesome relationships deeply inspire me to become a better person and more engaged with life. \r\n* Doing Good: I care about the world and aspire to be altruistic and work towards reducing suffering. The EA philosophy resonates with me and I\u2019ve been involved in the community for some years, socially and via volunteering in various roles. Currently I\u2019m figuring out what\u2019s the best way for me to align my career with these values. \r\n* Veganism: I\u2019ve been vegan for >11 years and it\u2019s somewhat important to me that people that I date pursue a cruelty-free lifestyle.\r\n* Movement: I\u2019ve been physically active my whole life and I do something almost every day. Currently I do cycling (for transportation), yoga, olympic weightlifting, and crossfit regularly and do all sorts of other stuff occasionally (inline skating, powerlifting, calisthenics, trampoline, bouldering, dancing, tennis, snowboarding, skiing, obstacle mud races, \u2026). I\u2019m fascinated by learning new movements and sports and am always interested to try new things. \r\n* Meditation: I\u2019ve been meditating daily for some years now and it\u2019s become quite \u201cserious\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s not something I do instrumentally for any mental health, productivity, or whatever reasons but because the gravity of being alive is such a huge and fascinating thing to investigate that I have no choice but to look at it. It\u2019s changing me for the better in a conventional sense as well. Besides meditation I also occasionally explore my mind through other means, like dancing, heat/cold exposure and so on. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Other activities I enjoy: Long conversations, clubs/rave, costume parties, building events/art, Burner culture, spending passive time with friends, meeting people to explore relating techniques/ meditation/ movement/ whatever (\u201cworkshop culture\u201d), consuming content for entertainment, knowledge, and learning (books, audio), going for walks (more rarely: hiking), playing video games, drawing.\r\n* I\u2019m politically left (on the European spectrum), liberal, and a feminist. Intellectually I\u2019m somewhat post-rationalist. I\u2019m compatible with both rationalists and hippies. \r\n* I drink and smoke very rarely (both ~2-4 times a year). Other substances are more interesting to me (e.g. psychedelics). I\u2019m interested in drugs and read lots about it (history, current research, illegalisation and liberalisation, chemistry, etc.). I like intentional use and doing proper integration. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  Photos: All 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDating preferences\r\n\r\n\r\n* Style: I\u2019m looking for a nesting partner/life companion type relationship where the relationship between us is a clear priority. \r\nCould be either monogamous or a committed primary open relationship where there could be side romances but no relationships that would cause regular negotiation between us (i.e. it should be obvious that it\u2019s us going on holiday together, attending friends\u2019 weddings together, building a life together etc.)\r\n* Kids: I think I want kids eventually, not in the next 5 years but more likely after that (meaning it\u2019s a deal breaker if you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want kids). I want to share  childcare equally with my partner, so I strongly prefer someone who is aware and willing to make the relationship and lifestyle adjustments that come with raising children. Ideally, you\u2019re excited about the prospect of being amazing co-parents one day. \r\n* Location: I\u2019m not into long-distance relationships so you have to live in Berlin or adjacent accessible regions. Once in a relationship, I can imagine moving elsewhere together, with a preference for European capitals.\r\n* Other preferences: Taller than me (this is actually quite important), non-smoker, no pets (negotiable), physically fit, kind, witty, self-aware, caring, wholesome, value-driven, somewhat eccentric, calm energy, curious.\r\n* What we could do together: \r\n   * Exchange physical affection (this is important to me)\r\n   * Exercise\r\n   * Have deep conversations  \r\n   * Problem-solve\r\n   * Work on a creative project together\r\n   * Meditate and share insights\r\n   * Dance to loud bass-heavy music\r\n   * Listen to podcasts or books, or even read to each other\r\n   * Explore food - cooking or eating out\r\n   * Host/attend events and parties\r\n   * Travel\r\n   * Go to burning man\r\n   * Psychonauting\r\n   * Appreciate art \r\n   * Relax and regenerate\r\n   * Generally I like to be supportive, affectionate, and nurturing. I\u2019ll probably remember your appointments, support you in life logistics and your larger goals, and think about your problems. I appreciate it when you are interested in and supportive towards my goals, if you\u2019re curious to meet my friends and family, and work to understand each others\u2019 worlds (that said, I obviously still appreciate certain individual boundaries and things in life that we do separately). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact \r\nReach me at @antoniabr on Telegram, antonia.82 on Signal, or email me at laremgruscht@live.de. \r\n\r\nWould be great if you include your own doc and/or some basic info about yourself plus some photos/links to socials :)",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffShir\u2019s Date Me Doc\r\nLast updated: April 2024\r\n  \r\n\r\nFYI: I found my person a while ago and am not on the dating market any more, but I\u2019m always happy to make more Jewish friends in NYC :) Reach out if that\u2019s you! I\u2019ve left the doc below mostly unedited regardless. It remains a good description of who I am and should give you plenty of info to decide if you\u2019d like to say hi.\r\n\r\n\r\nHello and welcome! I'm Shir (\u201csheer\u201d).\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve compiled this doc for any folks who might be interested in going out, or are just curious to know more about who I am. I\u2019m in the process of searching for a long-term (hopefully lifetime) relationship, and want to be upfront about who I am and what I\u2019m looking for. That said, I\u2019m open to all types of connections, so even if we\u2019re not totally aligned, please reach out if you like what you read. Chances are I\u2019d still be delighted to meet you. \ud83d\ude42\r\nWho I Am\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm 28 and currently living in Manhattan. My pronouns are they/them, with an occasional he/him. I\u2019m pansexual, nonbinary transmasculine, and somewhere on the open relationship spectrum. I'm Jewish and, as OkCupid would say, it's important.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a smart, introspective, affectionate, and adventurous person who goes out of my way every day to make my loved ones feel cared for and supported. I'm comfortable with hard conversations, interpersonal honesty, and admitting when I'm wrong. I make tech money but don\u2019t spend excessively; I\u2019m just as happy cooking basic meals at home as I am eating out. I'm adventurous, and will push both myself and you to do new things. And, I have some pretty awesome friends and a great worldwide community I'd love to introduce you to.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite things to do are go on long bike rides (50-100 miles), plan and attend events, and travel the world. I used to run the world\u2019s largest My Little Pony convention, which attracted 10,000 people to Baltimore every year. I play lots of instruments, including upright bass in a band that does klezmer-style covers of video game music. I love learning new languages, especially when I travel to a country, and as a result, speak basic Mandarin, Spanish, and Arabic. I also speak pretty decent Hebrew. I refuse to learn French.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPic from a trip to the Oregon Coast with friends (I\u2019m on the right)\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a wandering spirit (cough I have ADHD cough), and have moved around some. I\u2019ve lived in Boston, Israel, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, and am now in NYC, most likely for the long run. I\u2019ve also tried out a couple different tech careers: developer, consultant, and product manager. I\u2019m unlikely to want to stay in one place or do any one thing for long. I hope to find a partner who doesn\u2019t consider that a bad thing, and would like to join me on these adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPic taken after a 70 mile solo ride followed by a food truck stop with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m super social and enjoy spending a lot of time around others. In my book, the best evenings are the ones spent in good conversation with old friends, or at a house party meeting a bunch of new ones. I especially love connecting with other queer/trans Jews, but I get along with all sorts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think relationships work best when they have time to develop naturally. I\u2019d love to be friends first for a couple months so we can get to know each other before we decide if we want to try dating.\r\nWho You Are\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're a smart, caring, and adventurous Jew located in a city somewhere in the world. You\u2019re in search of a long-term relationship with the expectation of marriage and probably kids.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou're somewhere on the open relationship spectrum. At the very least, you\u2019re comfortable with the idea of your partner sleeping with someone else, and have a basic understanding of how one communicates about it. If you\u2019re currently dating multiple people or poly-curious, you don\u2019t envision yourself doing that forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou want to travel. You want to eventually settle down somewhere amazing and build a long-term local community. You want to keep exploring after you\u2019ve settled down.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou love to both talk and listen. You think about things deeply. You enjoy wordplay. You\u2019re intelligent and enjoy teaching others about your passions. You have big goals for your future, even if you don\u2019t consider yourself \u201cambitious\u201d. You\u2019re in touch with your feelings but not obsessed with them. You\u2019re not a particularly anxious person; little things don\u2019t stress you out.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing Jewish is important to you. You understand that Judaism does not imply being particularly religious, spiritual, or believing in god. You want to build a Jewish home, be involved in a Jewish community, and raise your kids Jewish; in the way that \u201cJewish\u201d means to you. You approach the topic of Israel/Palestine with compassion and nuance and would rather discuss your thoughts in person than online. You\u2019re fundamentally comfortable with Judaism, even if you\u2019re not involved in a community right now.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have a job. You have a dick. You're not a dick. If you like biking, that's a huge plus. I know you're out there and I'm manifesting you. Let\u2019s meet up.\r\n\r\n\r\nReach out to me: hello@shirgoldberg.com.\r\nLifestyle\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re still reading and curious about whether we might be compatible, here\u2019s some more info about how I live my life to see if it aligns with your preferences.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, I\u2019m somewhere on the open relationship spectrum. I deeply value sexual and emotional freedom in my relationship, but I expect to have one and only one partner who I place above all else, plus a variety of close relationships with friends and lovers. Think more \u201cgay monogamy\u201d, less \u201chierarchical poly\u201d. I\u2019m currently in a relationship with my one (\ud83d\udc95) and not looking to seriously date anyone else, but I treasure the many other types of connections I have with folks. Happy to talk more about this in person!\r\n\r\n\r\nI have celiac and need to eat gluten-free. Having a partner who understands my dietary needs and is happy to accommodate them is super important to me. If you research restaurants and find places I can safely eat, I\u2019ll love you forever. I eat everything aside from gluten and enjoy meat, dairy, sugar, and salt very much. (Especially bacon.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI prefer going out and being around people to staying inside, and arrange my life accordingly. I often panic about social plans ahead of time, but I know I have fun once I go, so I rarely flake. I'm an extrovert who happens to also be rather socially anxious (contradiction #1?). I'm the planner in my friend group, which I find both stressful and energizing (contradiction #2?). I'm a lazy control freak (contradiction #3?). So I enjoy being the one to arrange all the details and make things go perfectly, but also find it somewhat tiring. I'd love to eventually share planner responsibilities with a similarly oriented partner.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like alcohol \u201cthe normal amount\u201d. I like weed much less than \u201cthe normal amount\u201d. (No issues if you like it, it\u2019s just a bad drug for me.) I enjoy psychedelics, primarily as introspective tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like sex somewhere between \u201cthe normal amount\u201d and \u201ca lot more than the normal amount\u201d. \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\n\r\nI hate mornings but I\u2019m trying to adjust my schedule to get up just a little bit earlier. I\u2019m typically in bed by 12-1 AM and up by 8-9 AM. I care a lot about getting good sleep and enough of it. \r\n\r\n\r\nI only want to live in a city. I\u2019m not limiting myself to any specific country or geographical region, but I refuse to live anywhere that would require me to own a car. I also hope to live somewhere with a large and diverse Jewish community, but can compromise on that part.\r\n\r\n\r\nI keep my screen entertainment light and am not interested in a lifestyle that hinges on watching TV or playing video games most nights. I find it hard to turn my brain off for long enough to enjoy those things and usually feel meh afterwards when I do. I\u2019m down for occasional content consumption with a partner who\u2019s excited about it, but it doesn\u2019t come naturally to me. I read books as my primary form of media entertainment\u2014fun stuff like romance novels or psychological fiction. I\u2019m allergic to reading non-fiction books, but long reads on the internet don\u2019t count so my Substack subscriptions are out of control. Forwarding you newsletters I think you\u2019ll enjoy is my love language. Ask me what I\u2019m reading, I\u2019ll always have a strong opinion on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was raised Orthodox Jewish (yeshivish) and at age 18 went OTD, aka took a long and complete break from religion. I will never go back to being frum, but I\u2019ve learned over the years that I am inescapably and extremely Jewish, and that I\u2019m so much happier when I embrace that identity instead of running from it. I spend a lot of time in Jewish communities, participating in Jewish activities, thinking about Judaism, and talking about it with others. Though I\u2019m not observant (except in small doses), I prefer hanging out in communities that balance an Orthodox-esque approach to halacha with an acceptance of queer and trans people. Egal spaces tend to be a pretty good fit, but I\u2019m still exploring what I want from Judaism these days and how that squares with my OTD identity and religious baggage.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a Scorpio sun, Pisces moon, and Leo rising (let\u2019s be Co-star friends!). I\u2019m split between a 7 and 4 on the Enneagram (which tracks perfectly with the Scorpio sun and Leo rising - IYKYK). I think Meyers-Briggs is more ridiculous than horoscopes and don\u2019t care to know my type (okay okay fine. it\u2019s usually ENFJ with an occasional ENFP).\r\n\r\n\r\nDang, you\u2019re still reading? Thanks for entertaining my doc for this long. And seriously! Feel free to say hi if you think we\u2019d vibe \ud83d\ude42",

I\u2019m Omair \u2013 pronounced mostly like it\u2019s spelt, but there\u2019s maybe a hint of nominative determinism in pointing out it\u2019s like \u201cohm-air\u201d since my background is in power/electrical engineering. I\u2019m 27 years old, live in Seattle, work at a company I co-founded that works in validating electronics for space radiation. I\u2019m looking for a probably monogamous relationship with a woman in the 24-30 y/o range.\r\nLong version\r\nPersonality Traits\r\n* Curious\r\n   * Curiosity is very important to me. I\u2019m interested in many things and I like to try and understand how everything around me works. It\u2019s especially important for me to try and understand things from the simplest building blocks. You don\u2019t have to be interested in what interests me, but I hope you\u2019re deeply curious about everything that interests you!\r\n* Ambitious\r\n   * I feel like this is most true in my work, but shows up in other places. I am pretty driven to try and grow and make a successful company. I find it really fun to try to solve problems and compete in a competitive space, and kinda like the stress. I think in school this trait manifested itself in my immersion in student clubs\r\n   * Sometimes I set weird goals for myself and try hard to accomplish them. One example is with athletic pursuits like \u201ceveresting\u201d from my previous house, or trying to climb Washington\u2019s bulger list \r\n* Reserved\r\n   * Lean introverted and not crazy social, but I can somewhat turn it on in some scenes where I\u2019m more comfortable. I don\u2019t seek out regular bustling events, but I do occasionally go with friends and enjoy myself.  \r\n* Independent\r\n   * I want to spend regular quality time with my partner, but I\u2019ll still want to spend a bit of time alone\r\n* Altruistic\r\n   * Let\u2019s just be good people\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard dating stuff\r\n* Religion\r\n   * I am atheist, but am open to someone who is lightly religious or holds certain spiritual ideals. Probably won\u2019t match well with someone who is very religious.\r\n* Kids\r\n   * Certainly not interested in the next 5 years, but more open to it down the road. I slightly lean against it right now, but really not sure how I\u2019ll feel about it in the future\r\n* Identity/preferences\r\n   * I identify as a cis male interested in a woman seeking a monogamous or primary partner. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m interested in a fully polyamorous relationship. I would be happy in a fully monogamous relationship, or with a primary partner who wanted some side romances\r\n* Education\r\n   * Undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. Was a battery engineer at a few tech companies before moving to the radiation/space effects world.\r\n* \u201cVices\u201d\r\n   * Drink almost none day to day, but will occasionally drink socially\r\n   * Experimental with drugs for cognitive stimulation (caffeine/nicotine type), but honestly kinda scared so I\u2019m wary\r\n      * didn\u2019t even start drinking coffee regularly until 27 \ud83d\ude43\r\n   * Not into other drugs, but open to someone who is into certain other drugs\r\n   * I don\u2019t smoke\r\n* Physical\r\n   * 6\u2019 tall\r\n      * 6\u20194\u201d wingspan+disproportionately long legs, which isn\u2019t important in any way besides being kinda neat I guess\r\n   * ~145lbs\r\n   * I do almost no strength training besides indoor climbing ~weekly (aspirations to increase this), but do a fair bit of aerobic activity mostly outside\r\nHobbies and Interests\r\n* Reading\r\n   * Day to day I read a fair bit online. Mostly things like substacks, opinions, and some tech/world news. Sometimes even just wikipedia rabbit holes. I especially like reading books when traveling (which I do a fair bit for work). I feel like I\u2019ve done a really bad job at reading fiction as I\u2019ve gotten older, but I do like sci-fi. \r\n* Outdoor adventures\r\n   * I ski, run, bike, and climb. I really enjoy my time in the mountains and it\u2019s an important part of my life. That said, I think my friends assume this is a much bigger part of my life than I feel. I think this is maybe because I do more \u201cintense\u201d things than average. In reality, I like to do big day trips in the mountains just to enjoy the time far from my house in the city, lost in thought in a pretty place\r\n   * All this to say, it\u2019s important that my partner is happy with me disappearing for 1-2 days in the mountains occasionally, but doesn\u2019t need to share these hobbies.\r\n* Riddles/puzzles/crosswords\r\n   * Enjoy them more than I am good at them\r\n* Making food\r\n   * I used to very much not do this. Then, I lost a bet and had to make dinner for my house everyday for a month. I tried to do a different cuisine for as many of the days as possible. Now I like to dabble with cooking and baking \r\n   * Proof:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nqed?\r\n* New things!\r\n   * I may not share your hobbies, but I\u2019m happy to try (and possibly suck at) them\r\nInterested?\r\nNot convinced by dating docs yet, but they seem to be the best online method. I feel like these docs are still kinda weird and awkward, but they seem to be moving in a direction I like over match.com type apps. Standard disclaimer about how (online? all?) dating is scary and err towards messaging if you think we might get along. Get in touch by text at",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffWhy should I date Watson?            \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral info\r\nHi, I\u2019m Watson. I\u2019ve lived  in Emeryville California and environs for a decade but I come from New Jersey.  I studied math at Chicago (class of 2013) and at Berkeley (graduated 2018).\r\n\r\n\r\nMore specific info\r\nLooking for a long term nesting partner of any gender. I am a poly, kinky, switch, bisexual cis man open to having or adopting children.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen asked to give three words about me my long-term partner said \u201ceffusive, kind, gentle\u201d. \r\n\r\n\r\nSpend a day with Watson\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently I work from home. My work life balance is good. In the evenings I like to practice my ukulele, ride my bike, or watch a classic film at the Roxie.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve had the good fortune to have gone sailing with my father a bunch of times: including across the Pacific. I like to hike everything from evening walks in Claremont Canyon to multi day traverses of mountain ranges. I enjoy skiing at Kirkwood.\r\n\r\n\r\nI sometimes go to science fiction conventions where I sing and play the ukulele, and sometimes perform my own songs or do covers of classic filk songs (Filk is the folk music of science fiction fandom)\r\n\r\n\r\nI read really fast because I\u2019m autistic and hyperlexic. I like to discuss literature and films and spend too much time on the Internet. I also play a lot of board games and DM my own D&D campaign.\r\nWho you are\r\nYou are open-minded and supportive, creative, and caring. You are willing to take the time to get on the same wavelength, and you enjoy beautiful places, art, music, literature and terrible puns.\r\nWhy shouldn\u2019t I date Watson?\r\nReligion, sex, and politics\r\nReligion: I\u2019m Jewish and it\u2019s very important to me. I go to a synagogue on many Friday nights, and aspire to learn to read Torah and Aramaic to study Talmud. I don\u2019t keep Shabbat, or kosher, and I am willing to touch people of other genders. I am mostly a cultural Jew but I do like to be active in my local Jewish community.\r\n\r\n\r\nSex: I am bisexual, poly, kinky, and switchy, 20/80 top/bottom. I love rope and impact play. I would love to expand my skill set and am open to going to events and classes together.\r\n\r\nPolitics: I\u2019m a right Heglian now, after a misspent youth pursuing Trotskyism in the form of Postonian Freudo-Marxism. A far cry from the logical atomism someone said I radiated early in my college career. I vote democratic and am involved in local YIMBY (yes in my backyard) activism.\r\nMental health\r\nI am more motivated to do things when my friends or partners are involved. I have a lot of inertia towards projects or plans that only involve myself. Nevertheless when I have the energy I\u2019ll happily go out and plot adventures for a whole group of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can react strongly, especially when things are going wrong, as well as find it hard to ask for help and sometimes beat myself up.. The best way to snap me out of it is to be kind to me and offer a hug.\r\nPhysical health\r\nI have a rare genetic disorder that makes small bumps on my face and scalp. If you zoom in on the photos you can see them. They are harmless and easily treated. I am also very tall (6\u2019 4\u201d) but am fairly agile and I enjoy weight lifting and biking. I am happy to reach things on high shelves.\r\nOther relationships\r\nI have a long distance partner I\u2019m emotionally close to and visit several times a year for a week or so at a time. She also visits me.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffGina Stuessy\u2019s Dating Profile\r\nLast updated: July 2024 / minorly Jan 2025\r\nAbout Me\r\nBasics\r\nI\u2019m a straight woman, poly, living in Berkeley, California with my 16-yr-old cat and a (human) housemate.\r\nI\u2019m mostly looking for a primary partner, but would start any relationship out casually/see if we get along as friends. I don\u2019t want to have kids\u2014open to trying out being with someone who already has them, though. Not interested in dating people outside of the SF Bay Area, i.e. starting to get to know each other only virtually.\r\nI work in operations and finance, currently (and for 9 years) at Animal Charity Evaluators. Was previously a software and applications engineer.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n     \r\nThese are from Nov 2020 (sea lions!), May 2022, June 2022 (climbing), Oct 2022 (staff retreat in D.C.), and June 2023 (trip to Mendocino, CA), in that order. There are more pictures on Facebook.\r\nMore Details\r\nPeople close to me have recognized that I\u2019m especially: (i) curious\u2014about people and ideas, \u201cgearsy thinking\u201d, one called it, (ii) literal, (iii) trustworthy\u2014I generally do what I say I will, and (iv) caring. So if you\u2019re a very private person or need me to get all your complex metaphors, it probs won\u2019t work out. Myers-Briggs (but from almost a decade ago): ISTJ\r\nWhat\u2019s most important to me; unlikely to change:\r\n* Involvement in effective altruism (since 2013)\r\n* Involvement in animal advocacy (since 2011)\r\n* Getting outside quite frequently\r\n* Staying relatively healthy, e.g. through regular exercise, decent diet, and taking mental health seriously\r\n* Seeing friends and family\r\n* Cryonics\r\n* Non-religious\r\n* Making lists :)\r\nSome current hobbies and interests:\r\n* Climbing indoors and outdoors, hiking, tennis\r\n* Singing\r\n* Variety of social events: games, parties, small gatherings, hosting themed dinners\r\n* Travel, especially to a new country once or twice a year\r\n* Podcasts, articles, books on psychology, economics, critical thinking, rationality\r\nWhat I Want in Relationships\r\nI\u2019m mostly looking for a long-term primary partner, but would start any relationship out casually/see if we get along as friends. I\u2019m also open to shorter-term and/or less serious dating.[1] I\u2019ll describe what I\u2019d like for each type of relationship in the sections below.\r\nPrimary Partner\r\nThis is what I\u2019d like to be heading toward eventually, though some pieces (like values alignment) are more likely to be there from the start.\r\nValues alignment: I\u2019d like a long-term partnership where we are quite aligned on values like effective altruism, and where we\u2019re both working on something that is expected to be pretty high-impact.\r\nLove, support/growth: We would support each other emotionally, and also actively encourage and support each other in reaching our goals to become happier, stronger, better people living in alignment with our values. We would have a lot of love and care for each other, and show our love physically, through words, and by spending time together (and maybe other ways!). We\u2019d celebrate each others\u2019 joys and be there to support each other during tough times.\r\nCommunication: We would be honest, open, and have meta discussions about our relationship and ways we can improve it. Giving and receiving feedback can be stressful, but we would learn how best to communicate critical feedback in ways that lessens or eliminates the hurt the other person feels (which could be specific to the person).\r\nCommitment, security: In a serious relationship, we\u2019re both really willing to put in work to keep the relationship good, or to work through a set back, whether it be about the relationship or one of our own struggles. We would share what we need from each other in order to feel secure in our relationship. Even little things (like appreciating time spent together) can make a big difference.\r\nIn tune, emotionally aware: We would stay updated on what is going on in each other\u2019s lives, e.g. so that we can proactively support each other. We would notice and be able to read each other\u2019s emotions to an increasing extent, and respond appropriately.\r\nLogistics: I\u2019d like to live together with a primary partner, and I currently like living in the SF Bay Area. I don\u2019t want kids. I\u2019d really like it if we didn\u2019t have meat or eggs in our place.[2] \r\nSome preferred activities:\r\n* Cuddle ~daily\r\n* Exercise together weekly or more\r\n* Travel together (especially places where we can see wildlife)\r\n* Try out new activities together\r\n* Discuss interesting things we\u2019ve read/learned\r\n* Work on an intellectually-stimulating project together\r\n* Do stuff with friends together\r\nLikes in a partner:\r\n* Has at least some experience with long-term relationships (my two longest: over fifteen years and about four years)\r\n* Working on something you believe is really important for improving the world\r\n* Vegan\r\n* 27\u201348 years old (though this isn\u2019t a strict range)\r\n* Has some interests/activities in common\r\n* Attempts to live relatively healthy\r\n\ud83d\udea9Red flags for primary partners \ud83d\udea9:\r\n* Smoking cigarettes\r\n* Strong belief in pseudoscience things like astrology and healing from crystals\r\n* Wanting to keep gun(s) at our place (if we lived together)\r\n* Often being easily agitated or aggressive\r\nShorter-term and/or Less Serious Dating\r\nI\u2019m also open to less serious dating, and don\u2019t need as much alignment with people I date less seriously. Just communicate about what sort(s) of relationships you want, if you know :) \r\nConnect With Me\r\nIf you\u2019d like to get to know me better or just have something to say to me after reading this, feel free to Facebook message me or text/WhatsApp/Signal at +1 608-446-2243.\r\nShare With Someone\r\nLink to share easily: bit.ly/dategina \r\n________________\r\n[1] Also, what I want may change! I could meet someone great who has in mind a different type of relationship, and I might be open to exploring that with them. I\u2019ve learned from past partners and my own experience that people often don\u2019t know exactly what they want.\r\n[2] With the exception of cat food, until I can buy cell-cultured meat for her.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHi, I am Jess \ud83d\ude01\r\n\r\n\r\nGlad you found your way to my date-me.doc. Sit back, relax, and let me take you on this journey that is me! \r\n\r\n\r\nThe basics: \r\nAge: 36\r\nHeight: 5\u20193\u201d\r\nLocation: Manhattan, NYC\r\nBuild: Fit leaning Curvy (I am a Latina \ud83d\ude42)\r\nHair: Red-ish\r\nEyes: Green\r\nEducation: BA in International Relations, Masters in International Business\r\nJob: Senior Program Manager at a famous tech company\r\nLooking for: a monogamous relationship with a (straight or heteroflexible) men\r\nRelationship stats: Never married, looking for a serious long-term relationship (hopefully marriage)\r\nKids: None. I don\u2019t want any, however, it will not be a deal breaker if you have them - as long as you are a good dad!\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, hey, here is a quick visual!\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you still with me? Great! Let\u2019s get into more details!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe things you will ask me on a first date:\r\nI was born and raised in Brazil and left in 2010 to get my master's degree. Since then I have lived in 4 countries, traveled to 60, and have been in New York City since 2016. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, I travel a lot - mostly for fun. I am fascinated by history and always want to learn more and different things, that is why I try to avoid repeating destinations. I am a proud owner of three driver's licenses, two citizenships, and one permanent residency card - you will need your own TSA-Pre, Global Entry and Clear to join me!\r\n\r\n\r\nBut don\u2019t worry, I own my apartment so I don\u2019t plan to pick up and leave the city anytime soon (my friends made me pinky promise, so you know it is serious). \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is what I like doing for fun: pilates, going to Broadway shows, museums, concerts, trying new restaurants and bars, drinking Champagne (I am a certified expert) and going out to dance. I also need some downtime, where I mostly spend my time reading books (romances) and TV shows (mostly heartwarming/fun stuff).\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very career driven and I want a partner that understands and supports that. It is important to me that you are passionate and ambitious about something that matters to you. I am also a woman, Latina and immigrant, so I am very liberal and a feminist, and you will have to be too. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am alcohol friendly and I am ok with any other pastimes (420, Cigars etc) - if you do them only once in a while. On a somewhat related topic, I like my men like I like my ice cream - not vanilla. \ud83d\ude09\r\n\r\n\r\nNow a word from my sponsors (aka my friends who I asked to write this): \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom C (knows me for 10 years): My first impression of Jessica was that she is very confident, ambitious, and bad-ass and while all of those things are very true, she\u2019s also one of the most loyal, kind, empathetic and thoughtful people I know. If she loves you, she loves you at your best and your worst, she boosts you up when you f*ck up - and helps you see through the clouds when you feel gloomy. She will give to you, so make sure you do the same for her. Bonus points if you have a doggo she can dote on too. \r\n\r\n\r\nFrom K (knows me for 7 years): Thank you C, I wholeheartedly second everything you said! <3 Jess also brings an incredible sense of adventure and sparkle to everything she does. Whether it\u2019s a night in or a grand holiday, she is always fully engaged in the present - learning the traditional custom here, exploring a developing interest there, or giving you her full attention when you need a shoulder. She has the most incredible heart for service and truly cares about making those around her feel seen, cared for, and valued. This woman is a rare find. Trust me gents, she is the one!     \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a partner (yay - that might be you!)\r\nYou are consistent, respectful and reliable. You are happy on your own and are looking for a partner that will add to your life. You want a serious relationship and potentially see yourself getting married. You have a good job with career progression, have disposable income for 2+ international trips a year, and live by yourself. You want someone to plan your vacations for you so you just show up with your passport and credit cards to the airport. You live in NYC, or are willing to relocate here. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I get in contact with you?\r\nI would love for you to reach out to me via this form. I promise to get back to you! \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here are some more pictures!!!",

Here are some basic things about me:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I\u2019m a man seeking a woman\r\n* I\u2019m monogamous\r\n* I live in the Seattle metro\r\n* I\u2019m 25 years old\r\n* I work as a software engineer\r\n* I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d\r\n* I look like this:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nHere are some things I like to do:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I really like tabletop games. I host or attend \u201cgame nights\u201d of some kind 1-2 times per week on average. What I really like about games is that they\u2019re a great way to have social experiences that are different than what I would otherwise have and connect with people, and they\u2019re also a problem-solving exercise in a way. I especially like social deduction games such as Avalon.\r\n* I like (indoor) rock climbing. The combination of physical exertion with a mental puzzle is fun.\r\n* I like to read, think, and talk about interesting things. It\u2019s hard to summarize what I find interesting but the blogs Astral Codex Ten and Wait But Why and the YouTube channels CGP Grey and Wendover Productions consistently capture it very well.\r\n* I like to have novel experiences. If I have the opportunity to try something I haven\u2019t before, I usually take it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some other things about me: \r\n\r\n\r\n* I\u2019m kind of shy at first. On the Myers-Briggs personality system I am INTJ.\r\n* I warm up to people slowly; if we were to date the first date or two would probably feel pretty close to being platonic because I would just want to get to know each other.\r\n* I want to have kids one day, but not for a while.\r\n* I have been in one relationship that lasted about a year and otherwise I don\u2019t have much experience with dating. I am still trying to figure out how to do it well and who I am compatible with. \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m hoping to meet a woman who is:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Age 22-28 (soft limit)\r\n* Open to the possibility of a long term relationship\r\n   * This is the ideal outcome from my point of view, but I won\u2019t be disappointed if we end up dating short term or only being friends.\r\n* Close enough to Seattle to meet in person (I don\u2019t want to start a relationship long-distance) \r\n* Kind and honest and interesting and intelligent and conscientious\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think there\u2019s a chance we might be compatible and you\u2019re interested in getting to know me, I would love to hear from you!

Photos are at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick Stats\r\n* Male\r\n* 31 years old (Taurus)\r\n* 6\u2019-0\u201d tall\r\n* Grew up in central NJ \u2192 4 yr in Upstate NY \u2192 2 yr in IA \u2192 3 yr in WA \u2192 3 yr in CO \u2192 WA\r\n* Work in Mukilteo (30 min N of Seattle)\r\n* Vegetarian for >10 yrs  - considering broadening my horizons\r\n* Raised Jewish, don\u2019t currently associate with or practice religion\r\n* Liberal but also free-thinking and respect folks with other ideologies\r\n* Open to kids\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, I\u2019m looking for\r\nA female monogamous life partner, who lives in, or frequents the Seattle area.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAbout You\r\nThis isn\u2019t so much about me as it is you :) \r\nBelow are some ideas, not criteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou feel a responsibility to make the world a better place socially or environmentally. Whether that be through application of business to tackle a problem, or are in policy, or at a non-profit, or through volunteerism, or are in the process of developing a plan to do so (I get that some folks want financial independence before dedicating themselves to the cause). This motivation is a key driver for you, and something that you consider often.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are self-aware and are comfortable talking about your feelings and communicating generally. Down to shoot me straight and provide feedback before something becomes a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou like to cuddle. You are OK without significant PDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are active and think about health. You feel similarly that outdoor time and exercise are mentally grounding, and do these reguarly. You like to eat your veggies, and sometimes like to eat your wheaties (high-energy foods).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know what makes you happy, and pursue that. You can take genuine interest in a wide range of topics.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are a free-thinker, and have the ability to pull personal biases to the side to logically assess a perspective or situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\nAbout Me\r\nThe world is a beautiful place, and I want to learn how every aspect of it works.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince middle school, I have been passionate about addressing environmental and ecological problems. My perspective on these problems and means of addressing them has evolved significantly over the past 15+ years.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spend a lot of time in motion outside, it is meditative / grounding / calming. Also like to push myself physically.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do enjoy planning, but often have analysis paralysis, so can be an inefficient decision maker. That said, I love tackling small challenges. For example: We\u2019re about to have 20 people show up for this event in 2 hours but don\u2019t any theme-relevant decorations, hors d'oeuvres, or any chairs for them to sit in.\r\n\r\n\r\nWear a bunch of hats at work - on paper am a program manager, but also a process engineer, construction PM, life-cycle assessment practitioner, manufacturing facility maintenance manager, site safety lead, and financial planner. Master of none. Sometimes struggle with work-life balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years I had legit hobbies: involvement the world of traditional teas, gardening and CSAs, permaculture, fruit tree and orchard management, gleaning, foraging and fruit exploring, but slowed these the past few years. I am in the process of re-exploring these and new ones, particularly with a service component.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits of dating me\r\n* Emotionally available\r\n* Honest and upfront\r\n* Love to cook and clean\r\n* Will take interest in your hobbies\r\n* Have a lot of love to give\r\n* Like doing gross chores - happy to pull goop out of strainer, roto-root scuzz out of sink drain, and clean the toilet.\r\n* Will catch your spiders and bring them outside\r\n* Will bring snacks\r\n* I will tear it up on the dance floor with you\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat you\u2019ll be putting up with\r\n* Someone who gets ants in their pants and needs to go outside or on a walk/bike/jog\r\n* Often overly logical - some things in life just don\u2019t benefit from having logic applied to them\r\n* Good at thinking one step ahead - bad at thinking 2+ steps ahead\r\n* I\u2019m better at giving than receiving\r\n* I eat a lot\r\n* Although I love cleaning, I tend to wait until there will be physical accomplishment from doing a cleaning activity\r\n* I may go too hard on the dancefloor\r\n________________\r\nPhotos\r\n  \r\n\r\nI love toasting - it\u2019s a great challenge to concisely say something moving\r\n  \r\n\r\nHello! Yes, I snot in the winter months like a normal human\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nFood is only waste if we waste it\r\n  \r\n\r\nAlpaca farm near Loveland, CO\r\n  \r\n\r\nYes, I still have T-shirts from high-school hippie days\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nLook, there\u2019s another\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy sister and I at Mt. Adams - we both spend a lot of time hiking\r\n  \r\n\r\nNext door neighbors and my family at my childhood best friend-Nikki\u2019s 8th Bday\r\n  \r\n\r\nAt potlucks, I often have some form of veggies :)\r\n  \r\n\r\nI do own a suit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInterested?\r\n Tell me about yourself at ross.mazur1@gmail.com or Instagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\nThis date me doc was inspired by\r\n   * Julia\u2019s date me doc\r\n   * Anne\u2019s date me ppt\r\n   * Jake Gloudemans\u2019 date me Notion\r\n   * Lawrence\u2019s date me Notion\r\n   * Molly\u2019s date me doc",

I\u2019m Ben. I\u2019m kind-of leisurely seeking a life partner.\r\nBasic Stats\r\nAge\r\n\t32\r\n\tHeight\r\n\t5\u201911\u201d\r\n\tWeight\r\n\t250lbs\r\n\tLocation\r\n\tBerkeley\r\n\tRelationship type\r\n\tSolo poly, but in the long run probably want something closer to monogamy\r\n\tGender\r\n\tCis man (tbh if \u201chacker\u201d were a gender I\u2019d probably be that instead)\r\n\tSexual Orientation\r\n\tAbout 90% straight; dominant. Have some kinks, and like exploring, but not a kink-essentialist. I am actively into / not-threatened-by intelligence and competence in partners. If I have a \u201ctype\u201d, it\u2019s probably slightly androgynous women.\r\n\tBasic personality / identity facts\r\n\tNon-dogmatic, open, kind, problem-solving-oriented and ~75th percentile neurotic. I think humanity is massively underprepared for AI, and am working on that.\r\n\tLinks\r\n\thttps://www.benwr.net\r\nhttps://facebook.com/benwr\r\nhttps://twitter.com/benwr\r\nhttps://benwr.posthaven.net\r\nhttps://forms.gle/kVk74rqzfMh4Q2SM6 (use ^this form^ to contact me if you don\u2019t want to use facebook or twitter)\r\n\tAll other details (sex stuff, test scores, personality typing systems)\r\n\tAvailable on request (seriously; especially wrt sex stuff, I\u2019m happy to share, just not in this doc)\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\r\nRight now, I\u2019m fairly happy with my ~stereotypical bachelor-y life, but am feeling pretty ready to settle down if I can find the right person. I live in a rationalist group house with a bunch of cool people. I have one current partner; eventually, I hope to find myself in an extremely trusting / loving / comfortable romantic relationship, but I\u2019m not in a huge hurry. My imagination paints this relationship as monogamous, but I\u2019m not fundamentally opposed to polyamory in the long run (and in the short run I probably don\u2019t want to jump straight into a monogamous partnership). I\u2019d like to have kids, but probably not for at least 18 months.\r\nSome personality traits are very important to me in a partner: compassion, open-mindedness, and general wholesomeness are almost prerequisites for me to want to date someone. It\u2019s a huge bonus if you also want to talk about random intellectual bullshit.\r\nAbout me\r\nI often actively seek honest feedback from people, so I have a pretty good selection that you can peruse if you want. See Appendices A and B. My basic augmented summary:\r\n* I like making things, and I\u2019m good at it\r\n* I\u2019m like 99th+ percentile principled, kind, thoughtful, and sincere\r\n* I apologize too much, and focus too much on not-imposing on others, rather than on e.g. doing fun things. Relatedly, I am kind of persnickety, especially about where I spend social effort.\r\n* I\u2019m a good teacher, and love nerding out about things. Sometimes I can go a bit overboard.\r\nI\u2019d also add:\r\n* Since early 2022, when I was hospitalized for an infection, my health has been vaguely (but very annoyingly) bad. I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight, had serious problems with my digestion, and have been tired all the time.\r\n   * Around the same time, I was diagnosed with depression (possibly related to the fatigue).\r\n   * This has been sporadically improving since about June 2023. I seem to have much more energy, and my digestive issues are now intermittent rather than constant.\r\n* I am very into good coffee shops.\r\nI currently don\u2019t do illegal drugs, but not because I\u2019m opposed to them; I hope to resume very occasionally using psychedelics in about two years. See Appendix C for details about this.\r\nCareer-wise, I\u2019m focused on trying to ensure that humanity survives at least a few more decades. My background is in computer science and engineering, and I worked on self-driving cars and lab automation for genomics, before switching to trying to address risks to humanity from artificial intelligence, starting in 2017. Since then I\u2019ve done lots of things; some AI-related and some aimed at biological risks. Right now I\u2019m working at Palisade Research, on demonstrations of AI failures, and also as acting director of AI Impacts.\r\nSome random bragging\r\nI\u2019m really good at writing code. I used to do it competitively in college. I also designed and wrote big chunks of the software that's running the Cruise self driving cars.\r\nIn 2020 I solved an open problem in distributed systems (related to how one would write a piece of software like Roam or Workflowy as a \"conflict-free replicated datatype\"). I haven't published it because writing up the proof would be more trouble than it's worth, but I did get confirmation from the leading guy in the subfield that my solution works.\r\nIn May 2023, in a fit of frustration, I invented the \u201cwhiskey cleanse\u201d, which seems to have successfully solved my year-long serious digestive issues, which my doctor had been unable to solve.\r\nI\u2019m pretty good at sex. Of the six partners I\u2019ve had, two have said that I was their best partner to date (both from pools of 7-10 partners). One kink (sorta) that I will mention, is that I really like being especially competent, and ensuring that my partner is having a great time. I definitely don\u2019t want to promise that we\u2019d have great sex, since I haven\u2019t really subjected this to any selection pressure before, and the kind of people who date me are, by definition, the kind of people who date weird nerds (who might in turn be unusually bad at sex). But I think my track record is pretty good, at least.\r\nAppendix A: Anonymous feedback\r\nSome anonymous feedback I\u2019ve received in the last few years, via this feedback form:\r\n* I appreciate the sense of togetherness I feel when around you. It's like you're holding a certain kind of space for the world to just be as it is, and not to have to act according to a social script or put up a facade.On the flip side, I think you apologize too much. There are ways an apology can serve as a kind of shield that hides the acknowledgement of what happened. When you apologize I often feel most alone around you, like you've retreated into your shell.I'm glad you are who you are.\r\n* I think you underestimate how much people like you and how much they value your company.\r\n* Ben WR#... Engineering Type Pok\u00e9monBens can be found in the area surrounding the San Francisco Bay.Strengths: * I really admire your dedication to your principles. You are dedicated even by the standard of effective altruists, which is impressive. There are ways in which you could be more dedicated, but this is still one of my favorite things about you. * I like the way you go about thinking about \"engineering\" type problems. You aren't afraid of the complexity the way I sometimes am, and are are even curious about it. * You are great at being a socratic duck.Weaknesses: * It seems like you've developed some scars after a rough time getting up to speed at MIRI. Adding more speculation to the already speculative armchair psychoanalysis, these scars hold you back from diving into to your work to the extent you did at Cruise. It's plausible that now's a good time to renew your attempts to resolve these scars.\r\n* great guy.\r\n* You are often an effective teacher with a good amount of patience.\r\nAppendix B: Anonymized feedback from people who know me especially well\r\nI ran a birthday \u201cdooms & destinies\u201d conversation on chathamroom.com (a web site I made) for my 31st birthday, in late November 2022. I invited the 15 people who know me best (apart from my family), including 2 ex-partners and 1 current partner, to contribute any thoughts or advice they had for me (without revealing which of the 15 said what). Here are most of the things they said (leaving out some that don\u2019t make sense without more context):\r\n* You are easy for me to feel warmly toward, and to care about, and to expect care from, and to expect to have be able to care about other people. I think this is really great. It seems kinda rare among my friends, or among Berkeley people.\r\n* You are an attentive and sincere and intelligent conversation partner, and talking to you is in a nice way like talking to myself, more than for most people. It's probably important that you are reasonable and I trust your judgment a lot. And also that I think you rarely misunderstand me. It feels like we can talk with a lot of precision.\r\n* You don't work with imperfection well. It seems like you need to fix imperfections that somehow shouldn't bother you\u2026 [On the other hand,] You don't pretend that things are perfect when they're not. You don't accept things are good when they don't seem so to you. You believe in concrete paths forward to better things that you, personally, could start on today\r\n* You seem to want to trade or commensurate in an unusual way when it comes to human relationships. Like, \"I don't want to do X when talking to people. But it seems like I should be able to do Y instead [in conversation or elsewhere in life] and still get Z??\". I don't know if this possible, but it seems like it's not working for most Z\r\n* You are kind. It seems like your kindness goes first to the rejected and ashamed. You are not a fair-weather friend.\r\n   * +1. I also appreciate this about you.\r\n   * Yes, I would never worry that Ben would not want to hang out with me/care for me because I 'became less cool' or was depressed or something, he feels very dependable and loyal.\r\n*  you are good at making things! This is great.\r\n   * Relatedly, you are good at imagining the world in ways that it is not, and thinking them through, and good to talk to re this.\r\n* you have a kind of trust in your own ability to do things that I admire, and that I wish more people had. This is probably related to the person who said \"you are good at making things!\". In me it sits as a kind of self-trust, and I admire it and see it as a source of strength and grounding.\r\n   * +1 because I think this actually rubbed off on me some when we were working on something together and it's been a net positive in other parts of my life.\r\n   *   Yes I like this a lot about Ben. And in particular I think you do this in a way that doesn't make other people feel inferior/inadequate, you're being competent very much for yourself rather than performatively\r\n   *   I also find it both adorable and inspirational how much you are excited and nerdy about making and solving and building things\r\n* I think you tend to over-identify with things? With certain groups of people and identities but also with specific behaviors and struggles in a way that can be self-fulfillling\r\n* You decline a lot of invitations, but ask that you still be invited to the next thing, because you are actually interested but something is going on. This only works for so long. Ive seen people stop inviting you despite the requests because it gets old. As a destiny, which you do actually show up, you are a lot of fun to be around.\r\n   * my sense is that you get a lot out of being with other people (i.e. are not fundamentally a loner type person, at least in ways) but are often relatively alone because specific opportunities are bad in ways. But you then don't often cause social things yourself that would be good. My guess is that doing so is costly and not immediately worth it, but I wonder if it would lead to a better overall part of the landscape if you got an affordance for it.\r\n* I think Ben is very broadly likable. I don't recall hearing of a person saying they have negative sentiment toward him in general, and people often seem to have positive sentiment.\r\n   *   Yes, I think Ben is broadly regarded as a sweetheart and very nice to have around\r\n* I appreciate how much integrity you have\r\n* You're very generous with your time and efforts - I really appreciate times you've e.g. helped drive me to places, helped me solve technical problems, etc\r\n* You have too many preferences and/or pay too much attention to small preferences; on the margin, I think you should prioritize 'being ok with a wider range of things; learning to ignore annoyances or appreciate different kinds of things' over 'changing things to suit your preferences'. I can try to think of examples if that's unclear as it is.\r\n* You are a great teacher. I think this is a related to other destinies of groundedness about your competence, intrinsic interest in doing things, patience and gentleness and attentiveness with other people. You are very good at explaining things, sharing interest and excitement about them, not making the recipient feel dumb for not knowing stuff already, making it feel easy to ask questions, providing positive reinforcement for sharing confusion and questions, making people feel like a good student. It seems like you also enjoy teaching. I think this is an asset in life in general even if you don't make it an explicit part of your career, but I think you could consider trying to take advantage of this even more.\r\n* You score the highest of almost anyone I know on some kind of social attentiveness to imposition/inconvenience/asking things of people. This makes you very considerate and sweet, but I think it can also cause unnecessary suffering for you and others. I do think the underlying trait is definitely an asset, but you can probably shape it into something that involves less negative affect\u2026 almost all of your apologizing is for things where there isn't anything in particular I would have wanted you to do differently). I don't think this is hugely important - I see this overall thing as an endearing trait that's part of what makes you such a sweetheart, but seems like it causes you a bit more pain than is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix C: Why I temporarily don\u2019t do drugs\r\nI want life insurance, in order to sign up for cryonics. I refused to lie on the application, despite my insurance agent\u2019s preference that I do so. I learned that if you\u2019ve done any illegal drugs other than marijuana in the last five years, and are stupid/stubborn enough to tell them so on the application, they just will not insure you no matter what. So I\u2019m now about three years through a five-year drug-free period.\r\nI\u2019ve written a bit about my approach to honesty, which results in my unwillingness to lie to the insurance company.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffRyan\u2019s Dating Profile!\r\n\r\n\r\nDating profile? What\u2019s up with this- why not just use the apps? \r\n\r\n\r\nI noticed lots of people I follow on Twitter were making these. Yes, I know it\u2019s a bit awkward to read (imagine how awkward it was to write!), but let\u2019s lean into that! I think it seems like an interesting way to share more information than is typically permitted by dating apps. \r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter user @chanamessinger has started a twitter thread with a number of examples, and @FerrisHueller wrote about the merits of similar documents.\r\ntl;dr\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRyan McGuine\r\n\r\n\r\nAge: 28\r\nGender: Male\r\nLocation: Currently Kansas City, MO\r\nMonogamy?: Yes \r\nWants kids?: Eventually, but in no hurry\r\nLooking for: Eventually something long-term, but also cool with casual dates, wedding invites & generally eager to be surprised!\r\nAbout you\r\nNot \u201crequirements\u201d, but any of these is a very strong plus for me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal & professional ambition: You place importance on constantly improving your professional life, as well as mental & physical health. \r\n\r\n\r\nPragmatic competence: You can take on practical tasks and you\u2019re good with logistics.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual spark: You\u2019re sharp, intellectually lively, and curious. Big points for any regular habit of consuming books or audiobooks, blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nComfortable being uncomfortable: You are ok feeling uncomfortable for a period of time \u2013 including but not limited to spending long stretches outdoors, or visiting countries very different than America.\r\nAbout me\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nI am a mechanical engineer at an infrastructure construction company based in Kansas City, and I write essays about topics related to sustainability and global development on my blog, Sustaining Capabilities. While I sometimes stay in reading or working, I generally prefer doing things out of the house in my freetime. Examples include visiting with friends, being active outside, trying new restaurants, or attending live music and sporting events.  I will sample nearly all music and movie types- I enjoy consuming content with a reasonable amount of mass or critical acclaim, and trying to at least appreciate what others love about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have done a reasonable amount of international travel and camping, but have fallen out of routine on them lately. I\u2019d like to do more of each in the near future. I used to consume a lot of nonfiction explainer podcasts and YouTube videos, trying to \u201cunderstand\u201d the larger world around us, but have gradually become more interested in fiction, as well as learning about psychology, relationships, and leadership. Along those lines, I aspire to develop a regular habit of meditation, and generally be more introspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not in a hurry to start a family immediately, but have become gradually more certain that it is something I want to do. At the moment, I am focusing on my trajectory (career, social life, and being active), so that I do not feel like I missed out on anything, and that I have a financial base solid enough to simultaneously continue saving for retirement, continue living a decent life, and save for college funds when I\u2019m ready for children.\r\nWhat next?\r\nIf this sounds intriguing: fill out this form to go on a date some time, or send me a Twitter DM!\r\n\r\n\r\nJust reach out, or get a mutual friend to introduce us! My threshold for first dates is fairly low- I'd rather test the chemistry quickly than spend lots of time texting.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want a partner in the long term, but no pressure! If we hit it off but not romantically, I'm glad to be friends as well.\r\nWant to make a similar profile? \r\n\r\n\r\nGo for it! Dropbox Paper is decent for this because the formatting is nice, but you can use Google Slides, Google Docs, or anything else you like.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re on twitter, you can write a single tweet, or a tweet thread! Alternatively, just quietly link this from your twitter profile. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t have to post this publicly- just have your friends send it to people they think might be compatible.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffI am 24 years old, cis female, 5\u20196\u201d and 145 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am looking for a relationship with deep emotional intimacy, lots of time spent together, and a view to living together and spending years in a committed relationship. I am open to such a relationship having romantic and/or sexual elements; however, I don\u2019t really experience sexual and romantic attraction, at least in the way it has been described to me by others. I do find some people more physically attractive than others and am more open to having romantic or sexual relationships with those people, but sex and romance are optional for me and I don\u2019t experience anything like crushes or a sex drive. Relatedly, I have pretty restrictive boundaries around sexual activities in particular and typically want to do them infrequently. I\u2019m not going to give more details on my preferences here just to avoid a TMI situation, but if this might be a deal breaker for you feel free to ask me about it whenever you feel comfortable doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven my ace/aro spectrum status, and the fact that I experience next to no romantic jealousy, I would be happy for my partner to have other romantic and sexual relationships. \r\n\r\n\r\nActivities I would enjoy doing with you include dancing, singing, cuddling, improv comedy, deep conversations on philosophy and psychology, watching crime dramas and sitcoms (My favorites are Community and Better Call Saul), going for nature walks, going camping, going to the beach, traveling in India or Europe, and trying new and unusual things.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have taken the Giving What We Can pledge and I currently help organize the local Portland EA and rationality group which I founded back in 2015. I am currently unemployed but would like to work in animal welfare in some capacity once my mental health and motivation improve.\r\n\r\n\r\nI suffer from mild anxiety, low motivation (and occasionally other depressive symptoms for months at a time), and addictive tendencies (I am currently trying to get clean from kratom but am struggling and have repeatedly relapsed). I am on the autism spectrum (have you noticed?). I am extroverted, agreeable, and tend to have very low-conflict relationships. I have only ever been in one long term relationship which was very fulfilling and ended agreeably due to mental health issues on the part of my partner.\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy having conversations on politics and philosophy. My politics are fairly centrist with some left-wing and some right-wing opinions on individual issues. I am very open to having relationships with people that have very different political opinions to me. My moral philosophy is something like moral anti-realist utilitarianism with an acknowledgement that my true values (as revealed by my actions) are many and my moral intuitions will never fully conform to an internally consistent system.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not particularly interested in marriage as I see a lifetime commitment as being unrealistic. I would however be open to having children together a little ways down the line, especially if you can support me taking 5+ years off of work to care for them. If we did have children I would want to make a strong commitment to staying together as long as doing so would be better for the children than splitting up, and if marriage is important to you as a symbol of that commitment I would be open to it. I am also open to not having children.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am open to starting with a long distance relationship while I\u2019m in Portland and would consider moving to nearly any large city, assuming I am able to work remotely (bay area would be preferable if I can\u2019t). I would greatly prefer one with an active EA community, but would consider a place without one for the right person. I would enjoy living alone with my partner or in a group house with likeminded people.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I would benefit a lot from being in a relationship with someone more conscientious than me who could encourage me to develop a greater sense of responsibility and work ethic. I like to be pushed a bit towards greater commitment to my long term goals, as long as the encouragement is positive and not shame-based.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am open to a relationship with someone of any gender, up to 45 years old but prefer someone closer to my age (24). \r\n\r\n\r\nContact me on facebook if you\u2019re interested.",

The piece currently playing is Jean-Philippe Rameau - Suite in A minor/major. I don't enjoy the Baroque period too much, I feel that I am more Classical and Romantic. Modern is good but it goes too crazy sometimes. I've been learning a lot about the different eras of classical music through this project, you can check it out and notice that it is a tool for naive listeners. Thus, no, I am not a musician but I had a deep appreciation for classical music. I'm 40 years old and I'm comfortable in my own skin. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy native language is Portuguese, Brazilian portuguese. I started learning French on Duolingo for fun (387 days streak) however, Je ne parle pas fran\u00e7ais. I can understand Spanish but not talk. I am not a very talkative person.\r\nI actively participate in social dances including Zouk and Forro (my culture) and more recently in Contact Improvisation and Comtemporary dance. I am interested in Microfuzion but haven't tried yet. Connecting with my own or another body is a delightful experience for me. Dance is transformative. However, no, I am not a professional dancer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent a significant amount of my time developing computational approaches to analyse biological data. More specifically, studying the relatioships of epigenetic modifications and psychedelics. The goal is to discover novel plasticity mechanisms and understand how they coordinate the overall large-scale neural plasticity. Oftentimes it is challenging but also fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very curious and moved by an existential disquiet. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI live in El Cerrito, CA.\r\nThe best way to reach me out is by texting me at Instagram @marcos_abraao_art or Facebook",

I\u2019ve dropped this doc in multiple places, so this seems the easiest way to update all interested visitors. Best of luck to you!\r\n\r\n\r\nHi, I\u2019m Nancy. 32/F/NYC (but remote friendly)\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my lifelong goals is to become more of myself every single year. It is the most meaningful act of creation (rather than discovery) I can do, and I want to do it at an intensity that I\u2019m slightly embarrassed of the person I was the year before. I try hard to create my own sense of consciousness rather than inherit it, so oftentimes I oscillate between existential angst and actively white-knuckling figuring\u2014 often with a bleeding heart. I question the status quo, search for greater meaning, and try to discover alternative ways of being.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more deeply I\u2019m connected with myself, the more I can truly connect with others, without my projections, expectations, and dependencies. I\u2019m looking for a partner similar committed to self-awareness, with the eventual goal of healthy interdependency. That takes seeing each other for who we are, and creating space for both of those people and iterations of those selves.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral attitude\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage.\u201d\u2014 Ana\u00efs Nin\r\n* My default replies are: \u201cwhy not\u201d \u201cyes, and\u201d \"can we!!!\"\r\n* Variety is the spice of life\r\n* Courage the Cowardly Dog is my spirit animal\r\n* \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out\u201d/good enough \r\n  \r\n  \r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-professional Resume\r\n* Frequent solo traveler\r\n* Intl digital nomad for three years\r\n* Sabbatical was backpacking thru South America for 6 months\r\n* Fundraiser for grassroots nonprofit for working class Asian Americans\r\n* Built a community of Asian American progressive women to pass a NYC Resolution with City Council\r\n* Multi-day hiking treks in Chilean Patagonia, Peruvian Andes, and throughout Mallorca\r\n* Lived in a co-living community\r\n* 2 Half Marathons\r\n* Burner\r\n* Have guided 6 friends into therapy/helped them find their therapist\r\n* Have extracted myself from an enmeshed familial dynamic and have healthier relationship with parents (WIP)\r\n* Take pride in often being mistaken as my friends\u2019 partners (public acknowledgement that depth of intimacy is not reserved for romantic relationships!)\r\n* Can karaoke sober for hours  \r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t expect you to have a similar history\u2014 in fact, it would be great if we could introduce each other to new interests! Hope you are interested in exploring some of these though because it would be fun to continue onward deepening these interests together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Relationships\r\n\r\n\r\nI value and invest a lot in my friendships, they are the grounding forces in my life that enable me to go far and wide in the world alone. My friendships abroad simultaneously make the world smaller and expand my horizons. We heal and grow in the spaces between us. I love people, caring for them, learning about them, being close to them, advocating for more adult sleepovers, extended living with one another, building lives in community.\r\n\r\n\r\nI define love as a verb, a practice that you commit to, daily fidelity over grand proofs of love, demonstrations of care, prioritization of each other. What that looks like is an extension of oneself to nurture another\u2019s mind, body, spiritual growth. As James Baldwin said, loving anybody and being loved by anybody is a tremendous danger, a tremendous responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat being said, being committed to each other also means being committed to growth, individually and as a team. It could mean that our lives will be a little unconventional, or the distance between us ebbs and flows, or that we'll have chapters of navigating trying times. Hope you're up for lots of intentional check-ins, and being really accountable to yourself for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoving someone requires seeing people for who they are, outside of their relationship to you, and letting them be who they are. You can feel connected and invest in someone, but it doesn\u2019t mean feeling entitled to control them or making them your personal projects. I\u2019m looking for a kind of love/life that\u2019s triangular: an orientation beyond our love for each other, towards external elements in life \u2014 which is to say, life itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few tweets of mine\r\n   * https://twitter.com/nanseaful/status/1637917957329133568\r\n   * https://twitter.com/nanseaful/status/1633708623024074757\r\n   * https://twitter.com/nanseaful/status/1654829322807521282\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I like\r\n* Good food & cooking & sharing food esp desserts\r\n* Live music\r\n* Dancing harddddd\r\n* Learning at workshops, panels, author talks, book festivals, immersive theater, scavenger hunts, escape rooms\r\n* Hosting powerpoint parties, death parties, murder mystery parties, food tours\r\n* Commitment, follow through, trust\r\n* Deep conversations & probing questions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I\u2019m trying to get better at\r\n* Meditation\r\n* Patience with myself and life\r\n* Yielding control\r\n* Consistency\r\n* Resting\r\n* Forgiving others\r\n* Tennis\r\n* Surfing\r\n* Writing\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople things have said about me\r\n* High agency character\r\n* Energizer bunny\r\n* Impressive rate of follow-through\r\n* Community builder\r\n* Very creative thinker\r\n* Kindest listener \r\n* \u201cBeing loved by you feels like the warmth of the sun on both sides\u201d\r\n* \u201cYou taught me what friendship is\u201d\r\nWhy I will contribute to our arguments\r\n* I am a litte impatient (overbearing)\r\n* I am intense (tiring)\r\n* I am insatiable (unfocused & restless)\r\n* I overthink (anxious)\r\n* I bruise easily (see forgiving bullet)\r\n* I run late a lot (annoying)\r\n* I get lost a lot (annoying)\r\n* I lose things a lot (annoying & expensive)\r\n* I can be notoriously inattentive (see last three bullet points)\r\n* I sleep too little and late (worrisome)\r\nWays I like to be relation with my partner\r\n* Our relationship is our priority\r\n* Not necessarily similarity, but compatibility\r\n* Lots of physical affection\r\n* Info dumping\r\n* Conspiring to take fun very seriously\r\n* Creating our own world of joy > pleasure, soul > gold, creative work > business, meandering > perfection; impractical, local, small > capitalism, soft tenderness > control; going together > going far\r\nDealbreakers\r\n* Apolitical people - the choice to be \u201capolitical\u201d is usually just an endorsement of the status quo and the unexamined life. Also, I am the proud daughter of Vietnamese immigrants, so know that conversations about race relations (in the world, between us) will come up in the meta, value-driven way, but also the personal lived ways (cultural traditions & how we spend time with my family & create our own). My closest friends are LGBTQ. Our performed gender roles will affect what we expect from and how we relate to each other.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHello,  Thanks for visiting this page. I\u2019m Sohit and I\u2019d love to tell you a few things about me!\r\n \r\n  \r\n   \r\n^ me with my cat on the left. Me in London on the right. \r\n\r\n\r\nBasics:\r\n* I live in Princeton, NJ with my cat, Bella. You will find me in NYC every weekend.\r\n* I am 6\u20193\u201d. I am 26 years old.\r\n* I\u2019m currently pursuing my PhD in Computational Biology at Princeton University.\r\n   * I work on simulating proteins to understand their behavior better, especially for drug-docking and enhancing drug efficacy.\r\n* I\u2019m a straight guy and I\u2019m attracted to women.\r\n* Kindness and care will melt my heart. I believe in respect and consideration for everyone around me. I also have a strong respect for knowledge and books.\r\n* My love language is bear hugs, cooking for people, and writing postcards.\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies: \r\n* I love theater. I was in my school theater club for 10 years. While I no longer perform, I love seeing creative theater and regularly go to shows in NYC.\r\n* I love to read non-fiction, creative stories, professional development, and personal development books. \r\n* I also love writing:\r\n   * My blog is here: https://medium.com/@sohitmiglani/ \r\n* Traveling to learn about the world and all kinds of people! I\u2019ve been to 32 countries so far and hoping to keep the momentum going.\r\n* Biking, Knitting, and Arts and Crafts\r\n* I like to have open spaces to show my creativity and I always try to find art events.\r\nPersonal Traits:\r\n* I am a very low maintenance person and very calm.

(deal breaker)\r\n* Don\u2019t do drugs (deal breaker). Drinking is fine. \r\n* Love hugs (because bear hugs are <3 )\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I sound like someone you\u2019d like to talk to, you can email me at sohitmiglani@gmail.com .",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffLet\u2019s go on a date!\r\nHi, I\u2019m John! Email me at johnrwoolley0@gmail.com\r\nGeneral Me stuff\r\nI\u2019m a textbook nerd in a lot of ways: I like sci-fi, video games and programming, and I sometimes get fixated on niche topics like the history of earth\u2019s climate or Sumerian civilisation. I am always excited by the complexity of the world, and driven to understand whatever I can of it. I love the rush that comes from figuring out something complicated. If you\u2019re into something I\u2019ll enjoy learning about it from you!\r\nI get a lot out of creating things. It scratches a deep itch in my soul to make a piece of software, a story, a work presentation, or even a Minecraft build.\r\nI am quite independent-minded and happy spending time by myself (only child thing?). I\u2019m a \u2018small group of close friends\u2019 person. I sometimes have to persuade myself to go and meet new people, but I generally enjoy it when I do, and I\u2019m able to find something in common with whoever I meet.\r\nLast year I signed the Giving What We Can pledge to give 10% of my income to charity over my lifetime, and I get a lot of satisfaction and well-being from helping to solve the world\u2019s problems in whatever small way I can. I\u2019ve been meditating daily for a few years and it\u2019s been hugely influential on my life/ethical philosophy, as well as helping with my tendency to overthink and get anxious.      \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\nShorter points\r\n* I\u2019m 30 and I live in Manchester, UK. My degree was in mathematics and physics.\r\n* I\u2019m a software engineer. I\u2019m currently on a machine learning project (I promise to shut up about it if that bores you!).\r\n* I like reading books of all kinds (I read slowly but I get there!). I\u2019ve also written two (bad) sci-fi novels and I\u2019m trying to finish my third.\r\n* I exercise most days, though I\u2019m not a particularly sporty or outdoorsy person.\r\n* I used to play electronic keyboard a lot, I occasionally still do.\r\n* I\u2019m generally organised and tidy, with both physical possessions and general life admin.\r\n* I almost never do alcohol/drugs (except caffeine; I drink unreasonable amounts of tea).\r\n* I\u2019m open to either a mono or poly relationship.\r\n* I haven\u2019t thought a lot about having children but I believe I could be happy with or without them.\r\nYou\r\nI\u2019m looking for someone to have a long-term relationship with, maybe marriage, kids etc. I don\u2019t have a lot of dating experience, so I am generally open-minded about the whole thing. That said, I am attracted to femininity in its many forms (sorry gents, I\u2019m straight as they come). If you\u2019re aged 25-35, and living (at least partly!) in the UK, let\u2019s chat!\r\nBonus points if you live near to Manchester, have an intellectual curiosity, and would be up to playing video or board games together.\r\nTrivia\r\n* My best ever reddit post is a cool fact I learned about prehistoric humans. Other highlights include one of my minecraft builds and this thread I started just before Russia invaded Ukraine.\r\n* I\u2019m a bit of a picky eater (I lived off huel for a while) but I do occasionally like making shortbread or cheesecake to share with people.\r\n* I\u2019ve been collecting houseplants recently. Three and a half out of four are still alive, which I consider a great success!\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail me at: johnrwoolley0@gmail.com",

Straight, and looking for a long-term relationship with someone I like enough to build a family with.\nOther things you may want to know (no judgment, we all like what we like):\nI'm 6' 0\", middle eastern, somewhere between average and dad bod.\nWhat kind of person am I looking for?\nCaring and kind\nComfortable being themselves\nCurious. I love talking about ideas and surround myself with similar people.\nNear Brighton / London\nWhat kind of person am I?\nMy friends (if you can believe them) would tell you that I'm\nSmart, and like thinking things through for myself\nCaring\nA bit quirky\nThe kind of person you want as a tripsitter\nFor the most part, I'm average. You wouldn't notice me walking down the street (unless it's summer and I'm enjoying a barefoot day).\nI love to learn, and I love puzzles. The latter grew into teaching myself programming as a kid and participating in programming competitions. I've also had a long-lasting interest in science and philosophy and enjoy conversations where I get to learn something new about them.\nI taught maths for a while and loved it. I'm now studying again to start a career in software development.\nI am spiritual, but not religious. I believe spirituality is simply the skill of stepping back from things to get a better and more holistic view on them. I would also characterize spirituality as balance, or having a low (mental) center of gravity. I don't follow any specific tradition, but once in a while I will come across a text from some\nwriter\n,\npoet\n,\nphilosopher\n,\nthinker\n, or\nancient figure\nwhich will speak to me in that way.\nI enjoy connecting people who share similar interests (philosophy, spirituality, programming) and have either maintained or created small communities of interest everywhere I've lived for the last few years.\nI'm vegetarian for 10+ years.\nHow to contact me\nYou can send me an email at\n[email\u00a0protected]\n.\nEdit\nExport\nRaw\nPDF\nPNG\nPub: 03 Sep 2023 01:52\nUTC\nEdit: 27 Aug 2024 22:20\nUTC\nViews: 5124\nnew\n\u00b7\nwhat\n\u00b7\nhow\n\u00b7\nlangs\n\u00b7\ncontacts",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffBasic stats:\r\nAge: 32\r\nHeight: 5\u2019 5\u201d\r\nLocation: London (but I\u2019m American).  Theoretically open to a LDR, and geographically mobile, but the barrier to not-Home Counties is higher.\r\nLooking for: LTR, and yes, marriage.  Also monogamous af.  Sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\nI absolutely do not want kids, ever.\r\nSexuality: Bisexual, but lean strongly towards men.\r\nContact: lagilbert@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I Want\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly, the primary trait I want in a partner is intellectual curiosity.  I really don\u2019t care what you look like as long as you\u2019re interesting.  At work, I think about humans trying to maximize health and income, but I think I maximize on learning things.  I might be an information monster.  I just really, really love to learn stuff, and I really want a partner who shares this with me.  And I am looking for a partner - preferably for the rest of our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Also, I never shut up about the things I am thinking about, so if you don\u2019t want to hear about everything from neutrinos to genocide scholarship, you aren\u2019t going to like me very much.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLogistics note: I\u2019m immunocompromised.  This means I still mask indoors; I don\u2019t eat or drink indoors, and I try to avoid indoor crowds.  I like to think that this affects my life pretty minimally; I just eat outdoors, and I\u2019m happy to wear a mask.  But I do still take precautions, and likely always will; if this bothers you, we are not a fit.\r\nAbout Me\r\n\r\n\r\nMy day job is as a research fellow for Open Philanthropy, on the global health and well-being side of the organization.  I research anything and everything that might cost-effectively improve people\u2019s lives, largely in the developing world.  I really care about this; I largely agree with Max Roser that \u201cthe world is awful, the world is much better, the world could (and should) be much better\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my copious spare time, I\u2019m a QI elf[1] (yes, really) and an analyst for Geoquant.  In my further spare time, I am a Tarbell fellow and do some public facing writing on global development (see this essay in Works in Progress).  I am not not a workaholic, but you don\u2019t need to be; I care that my partner is passionate about something but not particularly if that something is a job, a hobby, or a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise (as per my website bio), I am being bullied by my cat, Lyra.  She is half my heart, and also very fluffy, so if you are allergic to cats, probably give us a miss.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome more bio stuff: Words are very important to me; I write a lot, am Extremely Online (basically exclusively on Twitter) and I feel like writing is an important part of the base case of Lauren.  I can\u2019t not write.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite this, my background is in STEM.  From ages 9-27, all I could imagine was being a physicist; I have a BS in physics from Caltech and did half a PhD in neutrino astrophysics at UCSD.  I then ran away and did another half a PhD in political science (really, applied microeconomics but in a poli sci department).  I interned at Open Phil and then just stayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not not an effective altruist; I don\u2019t identify as an one - for reasons I can elaborate on - but I spend a lot of social time around effective altruists and will probably take the Giving What We Can pledge in the future.  That being said, I am an AI risk skeptic, and not open to dating rationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\nI care very deeply about politics, and I don\u2019t think I could date someone I substantially disagreed with about politics.  I\u2019m a YIMBY progressive, a feminist, and I think about policy like an economist.  I vote in every election - even the primaries, even down ballot.  Also, trans rights are human rights.  (I can\u2019t vote in the UK, but would be a Labour voter.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI love to travel, ideally off the beaten track.  It is important to me that I share this with a partner.  One of my favorite places I\u2019ve ever been is Georgia (the country) and Uzbekistan is probably next on my list.  Since I\u2019m permanently remote, I occasionally work from random places (Greece and Mexico in the last year).  I also go to SF once a quarter and am back and forth to the States on a semi-regular basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic is also very important to me.  I love pop music, and I will not listen to takes that pop music is dumb and simple.  My favorite artists are Taylor Swift (I will see the Eras tour at least four times), Carly Rae Jepsen, and MUNA.\r\ntldr:\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven all this, I feel like the pros of dating me are pretty obvious.  I am always interesting; I am very smart and very funny.  (Indeed, one of the first pieces of feedback I got from a friend on this doc was that it doesn\u2019t show how funny I am!)  I am strong and independent, but also try to be kind and take care of the people I love.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cons are also obvious: I do not try very hard to be conventionally attractive; I will show up to things with wet hair and I don\u2019t wear makeup; the immunocompromised thing is mildly annoying; I am blunt and sharp and I am not going to parent you.  I\u2019m kind of A Lot and I have no intention of changing that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am basically seeking a partner that makes me feel like the Run Away With Me music video.  If this is intriguing to you, we could maybe turn the world to gold?\r\n________________\r\n[1] For the Americans: I write @qikipedia on Twitter a couple days a week.",

The top-left is the most recent, at LessOnline. My hair gets rave reviews for reasons I don\u2019t fully understand.\r\nBasics\r\nKids: No        Hookups: No             Monogamy: No        Relationship Anarchy: No\r\nAge: 33, mostly uninterested in dating below 25.\r\nOrientation: Straight, to a first approximation         Kink: An obligate dom, as far as I know\r\nContact info: ja.kopczynski ~at~ gmail .dot. com, Discord @_jisk\r\nRelationship Goals\r\nI\u2019m not currently seeking a specific thing. I would appreciate having a primary relationship. I would appreciate having a couple more secondary relationships. (Maybe even both of those.) I would appreciate a quasi-primary long-distance relationship where we spend a few weeks a year in the same place and are effectively primaries then and secondaries the other months. In general terms, I\u2019m a little under-saturated in close relationships and would like to fix that.\r\nValues\r\nEpistemic Rationality - I\u2019m a pretty committed epistemic rationalist. Believe true things, even if they aren\u2019t useful; say true things, even if they aren\u2019t comfortable. I don\u2019t pick fights about this much anymore, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s not going away. I\u2019m particularly harsh about self-deception. Beware telling yourself lies, because you\u2019ll forget they\u2019re lies.\r\nEffective Altruism - I\u2019m an EA in the sense that I signed the Giving What We Can pledge and roughly agree with the EA movement about what charities count as effective. I\u2019m not an EA in the sense that I don\u2019t try to maximize the good done - I delegate all the optimization to the big foundations and don\u2019t worry about it.\r\nAI Singularity - I don\u2019t expect my retirement fund to be worth the bits it\u2019s printed on. I mean, I have one, but still. We get doom or utopia; there\u2019s no middle ground. This doesn\u2019t come up much day-to-day, but it\u2019s there.\r\nHobbies\r\nGames! - I have a floor-to-ceiling cabinet of board games and don\u2019t play nearly enough. I have a list. Twilight Imperium is on the shelf twice, but I also love much lighter games like Tokaido, Tsuro, and King of Tokyo. I also enjoy many video games, D&D and derivatives (I prefer 3.5/Pathfinder), and making my own tabletop games.\r\nWorldbuilding - Whether it\u2019s creating my own D&D setting to run campaigns in or taking a video game or CYOA prompt and running with it to flesh out the world around it and write stories in it, I really like worldbuilding. It\u2019s much more fun with an audience, and collaboration has been fun.\r\nWriting - It\u2019s fun! And, surprisingly, uses very different creative muscles from programming, despite still being sitting at a screen hitting a keyboard. I have written a fair amount of glowfic, and a lesser quantity of standard-variety fanfic. I also have some porn but I\u2019m not willing to link that to my name in a publicly-readable document. \r\nMeetup Hosting - I host a LessWrong meetup in my (big) living room every week, rotating through topics. It\u2019s meant to be a place where new members of the community can meet established ones, and a generally structured social hangout for our many awkward nerds. Want to meet me without going on a date? Ask, or take a look on Discord here.\r\nFire Arts - I don\u2019t do this nearly often enough, and don\u2019t have any pictures, but I do fire spinning. My preferred prop is a pair of clubs, and I can do most things poi can do with them. I strongly recommend it - it\u2019s a good workout, and also everyone looks hot with fire in their hands.\r\nRitual Design - I don\u2019t do this as much recently, since I no longer think there will be enough generations of the rationalist community to need ritual to stay value-aligned, but I\u2019m interested in the cautious, well-considered use of ritual. And the misuse of it. It\u2019s powerful but dangerous.\r\nHates\r\nWoo/Spirituality - It\u2019s like religion but without the social benefits that made it worthwhile for most people for centuries.\r\nCircling/Authentic Relating/Nonviolent Communication - This is toxic coercive bullshit in sheep\u2019s clothing and I do not trust it within 500 feet of my brain. It\u2019s like someone decided the problem with social status was that it wasn\u2019t pervasive enough and was too easy to see coming.\r\nAnticapitalists - I cannot stand people who blame the world\u2019s problems on \u2018capitalism\u2019, talk about \u2018late-stage capitalism\u2019 (there\u2019s no such thing and that\u2019s quite obvious) or \u2018degrowth\u2019 (probably the most evil economic philosophy extant), shit on Amazon, or generally ignore the way that capitalism has pulled the world out of poverty in a way nothing else came close to addressing. It\u2019s a berserk button.\r\nDate Ideas\r\nI\u2019ve enjoyed\r\n* cuddling and reading stories aloud\r\n* watching shows together and riffing/heckling\r\n* wandering the streets and talking\r\n* playing games together - competitive or cooperative, board or video, puzzles, whatever\r\nAnd expect I\u2019d enjoy\r\n* going somewhere tall and enjoying the view\r\n* beta reading each other's porn\r\n* learning to dance together\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix: Detailed Explanations\r\nKids\r\nI do not want kids for myself. This wouldn\u2019t necessarily be prohibitive if my partner really wanted them, but IME I only like about half of kids, even the kids of parents I like. This seems prohibitive. Does not rule out me dating someone with existing kids if they\u2019re not planning to get more, if I get along with the existing kids, but it\u2019s basically prohibitive on the \u2018having more\u2019 front.\r\nMonogamy/Polyamory\r\nI\u2019m in a long-duration secondary relationship I don\u2019t want to break.\r\nI practice hierarchical polyamory.\r\nMany sources such as More Than Two will tell you this is a red flag, but this is incorrect. Hierarchical relationships set an absolute minimum amount of communication about the health and status of the relationship.\r\nAlso, considering the record of drama in the relationships of the authors of MTT, which produced multiple accusations of abuse, does not inspire confidence that their relationship advice is good. Also, all dramabombs I have been witness to in poly circles derived from refusal to label relationships or violation of the clear boundaries of hierarchical relationships. I consider this evidence that hierarchical poly is in fact a green flag; relationship anarchy and other nonhierarchical styles are the red flags.\r\nEffective Altruism\r\nI\u2019m not out to do the most good I can. I\u2019m out to be a good person by my own lights, according to a non-deceptive and particularly non-self-deceptive definition of good person. I thought about it for a while, decided EA was probably right, joined a meatspace community with a lot of EAs, still thought it seemed right, and took the GWWC pledge as a concrete commitment when I had a job and could clearly afford it. My last annual donations were an ad-hoc mix of GiveDirectly, GiveWell, the EA Funds Long-Term Future Fund, and MIRI. Past years have also included CFAR but they lost my trust due to woo and Circling.\r\nStraight*\r\nI\u2019ve dated transmasculine people but I lost interest as they got more masculine. I have not recently noticed any interest in anyone but cis women. Sorry.\r\nKink\r\nWhen I say \u2018as far as I know\u2019, I mostly mean \u2018last I checked\u2019, which was\u2026 like four years ago for most purposes. I spent a couple years asexual due to medical side effects (worth it), and that only faded this year.\r\nHistorically, I\u2019ve been interested in mild sadism, hypnokink, low-grade forced exhibitionism, and improvised bondage. I like rope bondage in theory, but getting real practice in is difficult without an accessible \u2018demo sub\u2019 so I suck at it. I like the idea of \u2018feral\u2019-ish fights for control, but it may turn out I hate that if I lose.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate me!  \ud83d\ude0a\r\nHey there, I\u2019m Brian, a 44 year old native of Austin TX!  The dating apps felt too much like a psychological-social-torture-experiment (that I was actually paying for), so it was time for something new! \r\nHere I am\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..laid bare\u2026..during doom metal goat yoga!\r\n  \r\n\r\nWho am I?\r\n\u00b7         Grew up on a ranch in Austin, studied computer networking, worked as Server Support and IT Security expert and then retired from it at all 33! \r\n\u00b7         Currently commercial real estate investor and receive passive income from those buildings, which makes time for all my fun hobbies. \r\n\u00b7         List of Adjectives:\r\nCerebral, generous, handy, healthy, funny, silly, (just a little) obnoxious, sarcastic-ish, ambivert, an inventor of cuss words, and sparingly (but strategically) vulgar at safe times\r\n\u00b7         Love Language:  Physical Touch\r\n\u00b7         I like to be valued, appreciated for my many skills, and lean towards giving Acts of Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonality (Psychetest.com) evaluations score me as The Chameleon and \u201cMiddle of the Roader\u201d and it\u2019s damn accurate.  Email me for a copy of my results \ud83d\ude0a:\r\nChameleons can adapt to almost any social situation, whether they're among a throng of partygoers or in reflective solitude. Known to be fairly friendly and gregarious people, Chameleons aren't hard to like or connect with; they're good conversationalists, good listeners, and great company. Although they're more than happy to join a boisterous get-together, they do enjoy some quiet time on their own as well. They're approachable and relatively unreserved individuals whose presence is neither obtrusive nor inconspicuous.\r\nMiddle-of-the-Roaders enjoy a good mixture of spontaneity and predictability, although too much drudge work will bore them after a while. Just when people think they have this somewhat conventional type pegged, the Middle-of-the-Roaders' underlying free spirit will occasionally burst forth in a desire to steer off-course and try something new and exciting. These are the type of people who will generally fly under the radar, but they can sometimes surprise others with what they are capable of accomplishing when they are able to buckle down and focus. This may be particularly evident when they are working on a project that they are passionate about.  Middle-of-the-Roaders are reasonably emotionally stable, so no matter how much stress they are under, they will somehow manage to set things at even keel...eventually.\r\n  \r\n   \r\nThings I\u2019m into..\r\n-Gardening / Horticulture \ud83c\udf35\ud83c\udf31\r\n-Cooking (I like to cook and make salsas with veggies from my garden. Lots of Indian food too)\r\n-Sculpting (\u2026and can make silicon molds, an plastic/wax/metal castings)\r\n-Making custom planter pots\r\n    \r\n\r\n-Travel (Been to 11 countries, 4 continents, and counting)\r\n    \r\n\r\n -Boardgames\ud83c\udfb2  (developing a card game now)\r\n-Video games \ud83c\udfae\r\n-Working out 4+ days a week (I prefer HIIT bootcamp style classes, but I\u2019ll hit a gym with you)\r\n-Books (most recent includes\u2026Stormlight Archives, 3 body problem, Kingkiller chronicles)\r\n-Music, concerts and festivals.  ACL is a yearly ritual (Weekend one 2023!). Very into metal \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb but I listen to alt rock, EDM, house, etc. From Tori Amos to Pink Floyd to Behemoth and Rotting Christ. No country please.  Here\u2019s a rare glimpse of my glitter mohawk at ACL.  The ACL producers made me \u201cNaruto run\u201d back and forth in front of the huge ACL sign in Zilker for their promo video!\r\n                                   \r\n-Investing (Real Estate, stocks, etc)\r\n-Movies and TV (still love Alamo on occasion, but I run my own complex media server at home to keep me entertained)\r\n-Technology  (generally anything goes here)\r\n-Late evening snuggles on the couch\r\n-Tea  (I love coffee but recently found out it doesn\u2019t love me \ud83d\ude41)\r\n\r\nStrengths\u2026\r\n\u00b7         Empathetic and socially intelligent.  I\u2019ve put in the introspective self-help work.\r\n\u00b7         Very self-sufficient:  I repair/upgrade things around the house, I am the IT support staff, car mechanic, stock broker, (almost) a vet tech, gardener, professional cleaner.  I wear a lot of hats and can converse about almost anything.\r\n\u00b7         Healthy\u2026never get sick (never got Covid somehow)\u2026.everyone thinks I\u2019m mid to early 30\u2019s!  haha. \ud83d\udc4d Was a vegetarian for 12 years.\r\n\u00b7         Very flexible schedule, and a good amount of free time since I get passive income.\r\n\u00b7         I have my proverbial \u201cshit together\u201d\u2026.but do any of us really? \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\u00b7         I\u2019m not into \u201csportsballs\u201d but don\u2019t care if you are.\r\n\u00b7         I have crypto but have no desire to talk about it. LOL\r\n\u00b7         Yep those last two are definitely considered Strengths when you compare me to \u201cthe average male\u201d\r\n \r\nMy stats\u2026\r\n5\u20199\u201d  - Yes that\u2019s my real height\u2026not 5\u20198\u201d, and not 6\u201914\u201d \ud83d\ude09\r\n165 lbs\r\nNeutered\u2702\ufe0f and Vaxxd \ud83d\udc89\r\n100% STI and disease free, and keeping it that way.

Sorry. Yes, I\u2019m serious. But I\u2019m in shape!\r\nTattoos on left side of torso, and a full sleeve on my right arm.  They\u2019re all nerdy; ask me about them.\r\n\ud83c\udf46 \u2013 just email me LOL.  Definitely not bragging posting this on an open document\u2026.\r\n\r\n\r\nLifestyle/Situationship/ \u201cRealTalk\u201d:\r\nHear me out.  LOL.  Stay with me now!  I\u2019m 44 years old and if you got this far in life without \u201cbaggage\u201d or \u201cexperience\u201d then you\u2019re in a totally different 1% group than the rest of the world. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\r\nCategorically I am a monogamist person at heart, but I have also learned so much by being open/poly.  Ultimately I\u2019m poly-friendly and could make it work with the right person, but \u201cmonogamish\u201d is definitely the direction I\u2019m facing now.\r\nMarried for 23 years (yep we were young) but became open/poly/whatever five years ago. Functionally we are separated, as she has a primary girlfriend she is exclusive with; we have separate bedrooms, and we live independent lives while co-parenting two older daughters. Both are high schoolers, and one is about to go to college. The kids always come first, but they are not little, nor high maintenance. \ud83d\ude0a And I am DEFINITELY not looking for someone to raise my daughters.  Working on getting a second home, but it\u2019ll be a minute with this economy and the state of housing. She is kind and supportive of me while I have had other partners the last five years.  There are no fireworks, \u201cred flags,\u201d or ugly dynamics at all between us.  She is gay.  I support her.  It\u2019s called love.   But she has her person now and I need my person too\u2026and she\u2019s definitely out there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m not into\u2026\u2026a.k.a. \u201cdealbreakers\u201d\r\n\u00b7         Insecure-Anxious Attachment types, or \u201cface hugger\u201d types\r\n\u00b7         If you\u2019re reeeeeeeally into crystals\u2026.probably not gonna go great. I can talk aliens and metaphysics or whatever\u2026.but if I smell tin-foil hat conspiracies\u2026.i\u2019m out.  LOL\r\n\u00b7         High emotionally oscillating people.  Yes \u2013 emotions are important and so very human, but my batteries drain faster around those that display a myriad of daily feelings.\r\n\u00b7         Trumpers\u2026conspiracy theorists\u2026strong religion/faith/belief systems. Nope.\r\n\u00b7         Aloof and \u201ccatch me if you can\u201d types.  This is a profound lack of social intelligence to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat you\u2019re not going to get from me\u2026.\r\n\u00b7         Marriage. I want to be together for the rest of our lives, but I see little reason to re-marry, comingle finances, pay for a wedding, and ride the \u201crelationship escalator\u201d up midway through our lives.  Let\u2019s leave the \u201cserial monogamy\u201d to the boomer gen.\r\n\u00b7         Children.  I have no issue if you have kids, but I will be making no more\u2026\r\n\u00b7         Phone calls.  LOL.  I\u2019ll take a call but they\u2019re not my favorite\u2026  \r\n\u00b7         Night-owl/party-animal behavior.  Don\u2019t let the fun photos fool you too much\u2026.I\u2019m a bit of a homebody, but I can burn it down once in a while.  It\u2019s not my primary method of operation, however. Definitely a morning person.  \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\u00b7         Cohabitation.  This one is tricky but I\u2019m not at all looking to merge our lives together and move in.  I reeeeally like my space and environment the way it is.  Hopefully you like yours the same. Can we spend a great deal of time at each other\u2019s houses? Yes! But a full time move-in? Nope, sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\nQualities I\u2019m looking for in a partner:\r\n\u00b7         has several of the same interests as me!\r\n\u00b7         appreciates and respects space so I can reset and center myself.  I not only value downtime, but I also absolutely require it.\r\n\u00b7         wants to travel\r\n\u00b7         is self-aware and understand boundaries\r\n\u00b7         has clear communication abilities (talking and communicating are two different things)\r\n\u00b7         can apologize when they fuck up\r\nUltimately, I\u2019m looking for someone to enjoy quality time, laughter, concerts, travel, games, and all-around happiness with.  Someone that\u2019s ok with the mundane, the \u201cregular\u201d walks of life at times. Let\u2019s be the best of friends forever\u2026..or at least as far as we can push it. \r\n \r\nHow to connect with me\u2026.\r\nIf you or someone you know feels like I\u2019m crazy matcheable, send me an email.  Yes it\u2019s my spare junk email, but hey, I\u2019m an ex-IT Security guy and I need to protect myself online, just like you. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Once we\u2019re that far, we can share social media so we are better acquainted.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffNice to meet you! I am a 38 year-old man living in middle Tennessee and looking for a monogamous relationship with a woman. Like most folks, I\u2019d love to find someone nearby but I am not opposed to long-distance either with the intention of joining forces one day. I\u2019m not interested in having kids and while I\u2019m an atheist, I don\u2019t mind it if you have other religious views.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a thinly-built white guy who tends to straddle the line between introversion and extravert; I do normally score an INFJ on the Myers-Briggs personality test and am comfortable with labeling myself an \u201cAdvocate.\u201d That speaks to my nature of always wanting to be helpful and try to improve things for those around me and afar via art, work, or just being a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n        Getting fancy! \ud83d\ude42                                         Standard-issue Jeremy\r\n  \r\n\r\nI found my current part-time role in marketing during the pandemic and enjoy what I do - especially since it is a non-profit. I have been in marketing for over a decade and found the scripting, planning, and development of campaigns very interesting. However, I recently got the itch to focus more of my time in the arts so I also spend half my time in my studio drawing, crafting the next big Halloween costume, or writing. I\u2019m thankful I can support my financial goals through work and still find the means to get into my passion projects. I\u2019m moving slowly into the publication space - children\u2019s books and comics - and couldn\u2019t be more excited about it!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nOtters - pencil drawing                                              Fancy Octopus costume\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAside from art-making, I am big into running as my main form of exercise. Hiking or walks through new areas are great and I am considering bird-watching in the future. I\u2019m a competitive person so board games and some casual video gaming are high on the list of ways to bond with other folks while also keeping the mind sharp. The Frist is among my favorite places to visit and sketch. I wouldn\u2019t mind some more traveling in the future, especially with a special someone by my side.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Parthenon - another great place to visit in Nashville; this is one of my favorite drawings in my portfolio\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIf you are an ambitious and/or creative person, I bet we\u2019ll get along well! I really admire those who set out and actually make an attempt at accomplishing their dreams, regardless of the outcome. My ideal match also values staying healthy, honesty, integrity, and patience.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m at a stage in life where I wouldn\u2019t mind finding my life-long partner though I feel there is still time to let things unfold naturally. Part of the fun in dating is getting to know someone so if I seem like a potential good fit for you, send me an email at heyitsmrj2@gmail.com and use \u201cDate Me\u201d in your subject line. \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you have a wonderful day and wish you the best,\r\nJeremy",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffLast Endorsed: 10 September, 2024\r\nKey Stats\r\n* Name: Charles R.-W.\r\n* Gender: Male\r\n* Age: 25\r\n* Height: 5\u2019 9\u201d\r\n* Pictures: at the bottom so those who want to read unbiased by looks may do so\r\n* Education: BSc Mechanical Engineering, MSc Applied Physics, MSc Sustainable Energy Technology\r\n* Current Job: Operations Director at family bakery\r\n* Kids: Have none, do not want\r\n* Current Location: New Jersey, USA (near Philadelphia)\r\n* Religion: Atheist\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for in a putative romantic partner\r\nSome concrete specs - to be a good fit, you should:\r\n* Be female\r\n* Be interested in a long-term monogamous romantic relationship, eventually with sexual intimacy\r\n* Not want children (ever)\r\n* Be roughly within the age-bracket of 20-30\r\n* Be located in the Philadelphia area, or open to a long-distance relationship, at least for the short-term; longer-term, who knows :\u2019)  I don\u2019t substantially disprefer long-distance relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesirable characteristics:\r\n* You have a good idea of who you want to be - I like to say that my favorite thing about myself is that, of all the people in the world, I\u2019m the most like the person I want to be\r\n* Intellectually interesting - whether that be by having a great breadth or depth of knowledge, argumentative skill, or a love of learning.  Anyone with interests as broad as those I list below and of a vaguely similar-ish flavor is welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship Dynamics:\r\n* I value friendship a lot, and think that a romantic relationship can\u2019t but be built on friendship.  At the same time, I\u2019m uncomfortable having to guess if a relationship is platonic or not - on such guesses, I have a miserable Brier score of >0.5. I think intimacy is best cultivated intentionally and with care, so unless/until otherwise explicitly stated, I\u2019ll assume anyone contacting me with reference to this doc is at least tentatively interested in a romantic relationship.\r\n* To my estimation, I think any relationship is like a tree - it has to be planted in a soil of at least minimal suitability, but after that, it grows based on how you care for it.\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014--------------------------------------------Further Information about me\u2014--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nMy interests\r\n* Math, Physics, CS: These are the core of my intellectual life; I would prefer a potential partner to be familiar enough with math that we can use mathematical analogies comfortably in conversation.  I thank god every day that I know about eigenvectors.\r\n* History: I mostly read narrative histories (of the \u2018one damn thing after another variety\u2019), especially about the Roman Republic, the Byzantine Empire, post-Renaissance Europe, and Qing to modern China.  Lately, I've been trying a different approach, aiming to get a more in-depth understanding of the Versailles treaty and 1919 specifically.\r\n* Debate: I\u2019ve spent a few years as a pretty active member (and eventually president) of my university debate team.  I love the sport, but haven\u2019t been able to stay involved post graduation.  I\u2019ve inherited a residual passion, though, for analytical philosophy and sytstematic argumentation as a tool for learning.\r\n* Language Learning (the useless kind): I spent half a year teaching myself to read and write Latin.  I can read Caesar, and am working on the Aeneid - this is an achievement I\u2019m super proud of!  I translated the pilot episode of Evangelion into Latin as an engagement present for a friend.  I would love to practice speaking it if I can manage to talk someone into learning it ;)  Similarly, I\u2019m more recently learning Ancient Greek with similar aims.  I did eventually stop resisting the pull of my heart and learn toki pona (a kinda silly but super fun microlanguage); after Greek, I fantasize about doing Esperanto but maybe I\u2019ll develop the self-control to stop myself by then haha.\r\n* Chinese (not as useless, plus way harder, so gets its own entry!): I\u2019m studying Chinese now, with the aim of reading Lu Xun and eventually some more modern literature.  I can read vocab-annotated editions of some real Chinese books, so I\u2019m on my way!  I can read pretty well but my listening/speaking abilities are way way lower for now.  As above, the ability to practice with a potential partner (either as a native speaker or fellow learner) would be super fun!\r\n* Rationality-EA Memeplex: I enjoy reading and taking inspiration from everything in this corner of the world, but try to keep some distance to leave room for the cultivation of other interests.\r\n* Exercise/Health - I really like exercising!  I haven\u2019t missed a day in ~ 5 years.  I\u2019m planning to run in the Montreal Marathon, and then in a few months to run the OG Marathon in Greece (from the battle site at Marathon!)!\r\n        \r\nOther pertinent information\r\n* Right now I work as the \u2018Operations Director\u2019 at my family\u2019s bakery, mostly to get some real-world experience after spending a long time in school.  I\u2019m fairly-seriously considering a PhD in physics, but am pretty sure I want to move on to something more technical and aligned with my abilities.\r\n* I am gluten-free (due to Celiac disease).  More generally, I find my energy depends on my diet much more than most  - I basically always cook for myself, and don\u2019t put more energy into cooking than necessary for a healthy-if-bland outcome, but cooking with a partner could well be fun and I\u2019m open to it!\r\n* In the past I was pretty (clinically) depressed (mostly because of the Celiac disease mentioned above), but this has improved a lot over the past 5 years as I\u2019ve taken charge of my health extremely seriously; this is relevant in that it shaped me a lot, not because I anticipate being depressed again; I\u2019m doing consistently very good now and definitely expect that to remain the case!  I have a residual passion for pharmacology and neuroscience to boot!\r\n* I do not ever drink alcohol (by choice)\r\n* I exercise daily - typically running in the morning, and tai qi in the evening\r\n* In demeanor, I\u2019m a superposition of \u201ctrying to be like Cicero\u201d and \u201cmaking fun of someone trying to be like Cicero\u201d - not easily categorized as \u2018serious\u2019 or \u2018silly\u2019, but a delight nonetheless, I\u2019m sure.\r\n* I\u2019ve never been on a date or romantically involved before - I\u2019m pretty sure this is because I don\u2019t understand how dating is supposed to work and not because I\u2019m generally awful, but hey, caveat emptor I guess :\u2019)\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\nIf you\u2019re interested, you can contact me by email: [Given name] [Two Initials of family name, no hyphen] at protonmail dot com\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014-----------------------------------------------------Pictures below\u2014------------------------------------------------\r\nI promise I can make other facial expressions, just not for pictures :\u2019)\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n\r\nA photo of me casting a die as the plane flies over the rubicon river (\u2018the die is cast\u2019)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, 3D printed elephants coming with me across the alps - so that I can truthfully say \u201cI have led war elephants across the alps\u201d :::::::::::)))))))))))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTrying to cultivate my Caesarian facial expressions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nManaging a game of diplomacy (the thermos is coffee and yes I drink that much every day :D)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMiscellaneous ones that I think look fun/funny, but the resolution is too trash to make them any clearer lol sorry.",

I currently live in the greater Green Bay, WI area.  (Go, Pack Go!)\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m heteroromantic and on the asexual spectrum.  Specifically, I\u2019m cupiosexual (Someone who doesn\u2019t experience sexual attraction but still desires a sexual relationship).  That said, I believe sex doesn\u2019t make or break a relationship, and I would be open to dating someone who doesn\u2019t want sex.  I\u2019m also a Christian, and my faith is very important to me.  I would prefer to date someone who shares my faith, but it\u2019s not required.\r\n\r\n\r\nI graduated from Northeast Wisconsin Technical College in 2017 from the Digital Media Technology program.  I am still searching for a job in my area, preferably in a video production type of role.  I\u2019m a very creative person.  I run a few YouTube channels and a podcast, and I recently wrote a feature-length screenplay.  I\u2019m a musician as well.  I write my own songs and recently started a music project with an internet friend.  I\u2019m also very computer-savvy, having created a few Hackintoshes in the past.  I\u2019m not really a coder or developer, but I wouldn\u2019t mind learning one day.  I\u2019m very much someone who likes to continue to learn new things.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopics of interest include:\r\n* Autism/Neurodivergent Rights\r\n* Theoretical physics\r\n* Lost media\r\n* Copyright law (reform/abolition)\r\n* Anything Disney\r\n* Music, especially:\r\n   * Owl City\r\n   * Coldplay\r\n   * Twenty One Pilots\r\n   * Imogen Heap\r\n   * Taylor Swift\r\n   * Sophia Fracassi\r\n   * Victoria Duffield\r\n   * Anything Pop/Top 40\r\n   * (I\u2019ll listen to nearly anything)\r\n* TV Shows, especially:\r\n   * Doctor Who\r\n   * House of Anubis\r\n   * Thomas the Tank Engine\r\n   * Castle\r\n   * General Hospital\r\n   * Ghostwriter (1992 PBS show and Apple TV+ Reboot)\r\n* Theatre\r\n* Writing\r\n\r\n\r\nMy love languages are quality time, words of affirmation, and physical touch.  In terms of what I look for in a partner, I\u2019d like someone I can form a genuine connection with who can take me on their next adventure.  I would like to try to get out of my small bubble and see what else is out there.  I also wouldn\u2019t mind working on a creative project together with my significant other.  My ideal partner currently doesn\u2019t have kids, but I would be open to starting a family one day.  I\u2019m monogamous and would prefer to date someone close to me, but I am open to long-distance relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry if this is all over the place; I generally suck at bios.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffJulia\u2019s date-me  \r\ntl;dr \r\nHI! I\u2019m Julia. I made this doc because I\u2019m looking for a fun and joyful partnership filled with travel, adventures big and small, deep conversations, and community. I want to build a (monogamous) relationship filled with intention. I want to be a team, be each other\u2019s sounding board about ideas that thrill us, be a source of comfort on hard days, and to laugh (a lot!) together. (Friends often comment on how much I laugh.)\r\nWe\u2019ll hike in the redwoods, lose our voices at a 90\u2019s sing-along with friends, and go on a quest to find the best ice cream in Sonoma. juliaheartsthebay@gmail.com \r\nSome basics\r\nAge: 40 (looking for someone in their mid-30s to mid-40s)\r\nGender: Female                Location: Oakland                Sexuality: I identify as straight                Monogamy?: Yes, please! \r\nHeight: I\u2019m tall! (5\u20199\u201d) and usually date people 5\u20198-6\u20192\u201d but open outside that range!\r\nWants kids: 90% no (climate change), but I love kids and have lots of kids in my life and am OK if you have kids already.\r\nThe 10% is open to it with the right person and circumstances.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nAbout you Not everything below is necessary, but if some resonate we\u2019re likely compatible! \r\n\r\n\r\nYou feel a responsibility to help others or make the world a better place, and likely do that through your work. This could mean you\u2019re a teacher, a policy wonk, a nonprofit worker, a doctor, or a therapist. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re an engineer working in big tech or selling things. This is a central part of how you operate in the world. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou are self-aware and are comfortable talking about your feelings and communicating generally. You have really deep friendships (even if it\u2019s a small number) and connections, and you are looking to build a relationship with someone and are excited about the collaboration that takes. You may have been through therapy or in other ways have worked on yourself. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou enjoy physical affection. You like to snuggle on the couch and give each other shoulder rubs. This isn\u2019t a lot of PDA when we\u2019re with friends and it\u2019s OK if you need alone time.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are active and think about health. You like to get outside and move in some way or play a sport for fun. You might also like to indulge sometimes, but it doesn\u2019t look like ordering in Domino\u2019s every week.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have your own life and you go after happiness. You know what makes you happy and you\u2019ve built that into your life. You have a strong sense of agency and in moments that you\u2019ve been unhappy (in a toxic job, etc), you\u2019ve changed it. You have a strong sense of gratitude for the things that do bring you joy.\r\nAbout me\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nI feel a strong moral obligation to help other people. I visited a number of developing countries when I was young and it really shaped me, especially my understanding of wealth and privilege. I have worked in politics, at environmental organizations, with sustainable farmers, in journalism, and in progressive advocacy organizations. It\u2019s a central theme in my professional life and a big part of my identity. I work for a startup that builds nonprofit fundraising technology. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have good work-life balance and boundaries\u2026 and I love having fun! I don\u2019t work crazy hours, have a very active social life, and spend time on hobbies. I love game nights, fun ways to connect with community, and opportunities to live life to its fullest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends are very important to me. I\u2019m often central to organizing social things in my groups of friends, whether it\u2019s bringing a friend who is having a tough week a meal or organizing a 2 week remote working house in Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m active - I play pickleball several times per week, hike, walk with friends, and swim. I like to be outside and in the trees. I had some serious injuries in the last few years (broke my ankle, injured my spine) and recovering from them made me very grateful for the ability to be active and pain-free, but also put a high priority on health and being strong.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI like adventures. I get excited about a lot of things - whether it\u2019s a road trip to Montana, hiking the W in Patagonia with 10 friends, or checking out new breweries in the Bay Area. I have worked remotely for 6 years and often visit friends or family or beautiful places - I love to life hack to make the most of things. I spent a year of the pandemic living for a month in different places with 10 friends \u2013 we got to explore, cook dinner together, have funny competitions, and play games. \r\n\r\n\r\nI love food - hosting dinner parties, going to fun restaurants, and sharing food. I\u2019m a planner, and would welcome a partner who is also a planner, or who complements that with spontaneity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther things that might be notable: \r\n* I\u2019m very positive and feel a lot of agency to find happiness. This doesn\u2019t mean life is always easy or that I don\u2019t get down, but I actively work to change things when I\u2019m unhappy or something is missing in my life (hence this document?).\r\n* I\u2019m a clear communicator and am comfortable being vulnerable. There\u2019s basically no such thing as \u2018oversharing\u2019 with me. \r\n* I\u2019m an Enneagram 2 (Helper, don\u2019t care whether you know what this means!)\r\n* My top strength in Strengthsfinder is responsibility (also don\u2019t care if you know what this means!), which manifest in my being caring and generous and often taking on labor when I see a need or opportunity. \r\n* I often process things out loud, and I\u2019m an open book. \r\n* I pride myself on my independence, but the last few years have honed my ability to ask for help.\r\n* I\u2019m someone who sees the silver lining in most situations.\r\nAbout \u201cus\u201d\r\nMy vision for a relationship \u2026 \r\n* I have a pretty strong belief that relationships don\u2019t just happen and aren\u2019t just about finding the right match, they take active work. The relationships I most admire in friends have often included couples counseling and working through tough periods in a way that resulted in being closer and stronger as a couple. I like having regular relationship check-ins, talking through what is and isn\u2019t working for each of us, and brainstorming how we can better support each other.\r\n* I care deeply about respecting my partner and what they do and how they exist in the world, and want that in return.\r\n* My top love languages are physical touch and acts of service. My best relationships have included mutually taking care of each other and wanting to do things to make the other happy. One ex and I did fun \u201csurprise trips\u201d for each other regularly. \r\n* Sharing labor is very important to me \u2013 this can look a lot of ways, but it hasn\u2019t worked for me in relationships when I feel like I\u2019m doing a lot more of the relationship work (bringing up hard conversations) or the actual work (household work, planning, etc). As a result, it has meant a lot to me when a partner takes things on that I haven\u2019t thought about yet or I didn\u2019t ask them to do. Just because I can do it all on my own doesn\u2019t mean I want to.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat next?\r\nHow to reach out: email juliaheartsthebay@gmail.com. I like directness - feel free to dive in to explore potential dealbreakers or suggest a date. \r\n\r\n\r\n(Some people wanted more info\u2026 if you want more, this is for you!)\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaning into the \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as oversharing,\u201d here are some reflections on past relationships:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy did some of my last relationships not work out? \r\n* We didn\u2019t want the same lifestyle (he wanted #vanlife)\r\n* We didn\u2019t want to live in the same place (I wanted to be in California)\r\n* Our politics (and underlying values) were too different \r\n* We had different approaches to relationships \u2013 they felt like it should just work or not work, and I wanted to be on an ongoing journey together to make it work\r\n* We had different communication styles and preferences \u2013 I would rather talk and hear about what\u2019s not working so we can solve it together and understand each other better, but they found that to be stressful\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat might be things my exes say about me? \r\n\r\n\r\nSome good stuff: \r\n* I\u2019m very caring and thoughtful and generous\r\n* I laugh a lot and love to have fun and I feel excitement and awe at small and big things alike\r\n* I bring up the hard things and am willing to do the work, whether it\u2019s together or work I need to do on my end\r\n* I have great friends!! \r\n* I am great at logistics and making things happen\r\n\r\n\r\nSome bad stuff: \r\n* I have a full life and time with friends is a priority (for an ex who wanted to spend most nights together, this was tough)\r\n* It\u2019s hard for me to feel deeply connected to people who don\u2019t care about and prioritize making the world better; people I\u2019ve dated who were, say, a data scientist at an e-commerce company, found this to be really dogmatic. \r\n* I\u2019m not hesitant to bring up things that aren\u2019t working for me; especially when I\u2019ve dated people who don\u2019t feel as comfortable doing this, what I have brought up weighed on them or it felt like to them that I couldn\u2019t be happy in the relationship.\r\n* I\u2019m better at giving than receiving - in my best relationships we\u2019ve both given a lot and enjoyed that, but I\u2019ve also had relationships where they\u2019ve felt like it\u2019s a burden. One ex said \u201ccan\u2019t you just do fewer things for me, so I don\u2019t feel like I have to do things for you?\u201d BUT I also am working on being better at asking for help and receiving it. \r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for someone who read all of this and is curious, felt that some of this resonated with them, has questions\u2026 reach out! Looking forward to connecting with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nInspired by other friends\u2019 profiles\u2026 thank you. Also, if you want to date a different Bay Area pickleball fanatic who cares about making the world a better place, check out Taren's date-me page as well! She\u2019s a great friend and an inspiring changemaker, and I want her to find her person too!",

My name is Cory Hinkle and I am 26 and am based in Brookville, IN.  I am 5\u20198\u201d and am a Christian.  I\u2019ve worked in non profit retail at Goodwill for 3 1/2 years and counting.  I enjoy my job, coworkers and the donors I get to help out every day.  Some qualities I believe describe myself are family-oriented, hard working, honest, shy, introverted nerd with a big heart for the people he cares about.  I am looking for a serious, monogamous relationship with a female around the 23-29 age range, preferably Christian.  I\u2019m open to having kids in the long-term, but not interested currently as I help raise my niece already.  She means the world to me and fills that role at the moment.  \r\nHobbies/Interests\r\n* Church\r\n* Video games\r\n* Walking \r\n                  * Archery\r\n                  * Hanging with Family and Friends\r\n                  * WWE & AEW\r\n                  * Shopping, Swimming, Bowling\r\n                  * Alternative Rock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonest Fact about myself:\r\nI just want to be open with whoever reads this and is interested in getting to know me.  I'm usually shy and keep to myself. People that are close to me have always said that I\u2019m quiet at first, but can talk your head off once I warm up to you and get to know you better.  I\u2019m looking for a girl who isn\u2019t afraid of being her honest self with me and is looking for the same in her partner.  I'd love to spend time together getting to know one another and small things like sharing how each other's days went.  I like who I am and God\u2019s blessed me beyond what I could ever write down in this document.\r\nConclusion\r\nI hope if you are interested in getting to know one another better, you can dm me at my Twitter handle @coryclauz, or caboose2233 on my Instagram.  I am open to traveling around the Southeastern Indiana and Southwestern Ohio area if you are close and want to meet and go on a date together if we hit it off.  I am open to going to church together, walking, gaming together or whatever idea you have that sounds like fun.  I hope you have a great day either way if you took the time to read all of this!  Thank you!",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHow to Date me  \r\nStats\r\nAge: 42 (I have that Asian gene that makes me look 10 years younger).\r\nEthnicity: Asian \r\nHeight:  160cm\r\nLocation: Currently based in Incheon/Seoul, South Korea, open to long-distance or relocating.\r\nJob: Currently I am working as a consultant in the field of international development.\r\nPoly: Mostly monogamous but open to poly under the condition of well-defined terms and understanding\r\nSexuality: Straight\r\nReligion: Agnostic, I like the concept of Buddhism and its practicality. \r\nWant kids?: Yes (more info. below) \r\nWants to be stay-at-home-parent?: Possible. Always up for negotiation \r\nPersonability type: MBTI: ENTP/ENFP/ENTJ (I am multilingual and multi-personified)\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for: Primarily a long term committed partner to build a life together (although open to short term things)\r\nWhere to find me online: seminshim on IG\r\nWhere I am coming from\r\n* Matters of the heart/passion: My first love was architecture. I loved it. I loved reading it, looking at it, learning about it, drawing it, imagining it, and bringing it to life. But, I was worn down by the sexist culture (at least in the architecture industry in South Korea 20 years ago) and no sight of work-life-balance). So, I decided that even if I loved it, I wouldn\u2019t marry it. I generally believe in the power of how humans have settled and constructed cities on the planet. I am a feminist who seeks to address the various injustices occurring in my home country, South Korea. While I may not possess extensive knowledge of feminism, I possess a keen sense of injustice and am passionate about gender equality. \r\n* Matters of work: I have been involved in the field of international development for over a decade. I pursued a master\u2019s degree in urban development with a focus on developing countries. Throughout my career, I have worked for international organizations, including the United Nations. Currently, I am based in South Korea, working as a consultant for governments and NGOs. I value the experiences I have gained from living and working in three different continents and seven countries - Cameroon, Senegal, Chad, Paraguay, Germany, Italy, and Belgium. Thanks to these experiences and my love of language, I am fluent in English, French, and Spanish, in addition to my mother tongue, Korean, and I understand German and speak very expressive Italian hand-gestures. \r\n* Matters of human connections: \"Lacan on Love\" by Bruce Fink was insightful in that it helped me understand and rationalize my own attachment style. I have also been persuaded by Dr. Helen Fisher's work on human mating and relationships. Alain de Botton's books, including \u201cOn Love\u201d and \u201cThe Course of Love,\u201d have helped me see what is actually going on when I fall in love, enter a relationship, and fall out of love. And his NYT piece, titled \"Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person,\" was a chance to reevaluate my own perspectives on love and its complexities (as much as 500 Days of Summer did). Of course, I get excited, feeling jittery, and more deeply connected to one person than  another, but I do value skills to love, and believe we can all grow those skills. \r\n* Matters of living: For over a decade, I\u2019ve been part of an online support group. We\u2019re a fabulous foursome, sharing our aspirations, goals, areas for improvement, and achievements. We support each other, find the best ways to reach our objectives, and celebrate progress. Thanks to these amazing individuals scattered around the world, I\u2019ve become a better version of myself - a more productive, positive, and a better functioning adult. \r\n* Matters of marriage, having a family and all that jazz: When I was 21 years old, I decided not to procreate, due to my aversion to too much emphasis on nuclear families in South Korea. I was also concerned about global overpopulation. But, the events of 2020, particularly the pandemic, prompted a shift in my perspective. I now desire marriage or a long-term commitment and a family. To ensure this works harmoniously with my concerns about climate change, I endeavoured  to work on addressing climate change - currently working on a decarbonization project for port cities, and I had my eggs frozen. \r\n* Matters of perspectives: I'm a growth-mindset person. My life's mission is to adapt to a goal-oriented society while savouring the process and, if possible, becoming a force for change. I thrive on challenges that push me to learn and grow. Maintaining both physical and mental health is important to me, so I try to avoid excess while still retaining a childlike sense of wonder and fun. I am open to exploring polyamorous relationships as they provide opportunities for self-discovery, understanding the other partner better, and exploring possibilities beyond societal norms. We will definitely talk about intentions, the inevitable presence of jealousy, self-doubt, self-worth, entitlement, as well as the importance of kindness and compassion among all individuals involved in such relationships.\r\n* Random things about me: In my 20s, I wanted to switch my career to become a journalist after leaving the architecture industry I mentioned above. Before making a decision, I went on a backpacking trip across China, Tibet, Nepal, India, and Thailand for two months to see if I was cut out for it. During my time in Nepal, I shared a trekking path with a WFP staffer, with whom I shared the ritual of having warmed rum and honey under the starry sky of Poon Hill, nourishing our tired legs and souls.I wrongly romanticised this experience, which subsequently laid the foundation for my journey into the field of international development. Additionally, I am in possession of the first printed edition of Joan Didion's \"Play It as It Lays,\" which is currently being auctioned at a price of $1,000.\r\nWho might be a good fit\r\nSome words that jump to mind\r\n* Open-minded to new experiences \r\n* Know how to cherish the moment and life in general \r\n* Intelligent\r\n* Love reading and discussing it\r\n* Kind and compassionate \r\n* Patient \r\n* Enjoy dancing; no need to be good at it.  \r\n* Maybe a bit weird (to zig to my zag)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can I offer as a date/partner/friend/brainstormer? \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat next? \r\n\r\n\r\nIf any of this sounds good, reach out!

Wonder Woman is a perpetual Halloween costume; I even have the boots! The Biomarkers pic is a screengrab from Function Health, as of Dec 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, hi there. \r\nYou know what they say about the definition of insanity? So here I am, trying something new. After mixed results on dating apps, I read the article about \u201cDate Me Docs\u201d in the NYTimes and thought, sounds crazy enough to work. I like the bespoke, unstructured format, and thought it would resonate with \u201cmy kind of guy\u201d.   Believing it\u2019s true that \u2013 \r\n                   \u201cfortune favors the brave,\u201d\r\nhere I am, baring my soul to the interwebs.\r\nI was born in 1963 (see the pic on my biological age \u2013 48.4 as of 2024;) \u2013  I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d. I seem younger and (even) taller, or so they say.  While I split my time between Louisville and Chicago, I am 100% free to roam (thanks to a remote job, an itinerant nature, and a flight attendant daughter).  I grew up in New Jersey and have lived in Atlanta, Chicago, LA, and NC. I\u2019m a certified city mouse and enjoy day trips to quieter locales. Hobbies and passions include home renovation/DIY, healthy vegetarian cooking (farmer\u2019s market to table), stand-up comedy, live/outdoor music, and personal development.  I\u2019m not religious, but like Annie Savoy in Bull Durham, I\u2019ve dabbled w/many spiritual traditions including Buddhism (I consider myself \u201cBuddhish\u201d), meditation, radical gratitude, personal development and standing barefoot outside during a full moon (have you heard about earthing?).  I\u2019m warm, affectionate, physical, and come from a loud, close, funny family.\r\nYou\u2019re amazing because you\u2019re:\r\n* Open-minded (must be if you\u2019re still reading!) You\u2019re curious and enthusiastic, and have lots of interests and passions you\u2019re excited to share. You read, listen to podcasts, etc. to expand your worldview.\r\n* Kind and able to put yourself in others\u2019 shoes.\r\n* Tall (yes, I know everyone says that but I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d so I call dibs!)\r\n* Smart, well-informed, well-read, nerdy, and/or into the NYTimes spelling bee or crossword (or will help me with the Qs about sports and astronauts). Smart+ verbal = sexy!\r\n* Masculine, warm/affectionate/passionate, and bring the zaza zu. Comfortable discussing sex and expressing wants/needs.\r\n* Open to trying, doing, eating, and experiencing new things.\r\n* In possession of power tools or excited to use mine.  DIY together = sexy! Ask me about my tiny house;)\r\n* Health-conscious (diet/exercise/wellness) or at least willing to humor me in my latest \u201cprogram\u201d. Some of my current interests include Wim Hof, the microbiome, telomeres, and the fact that Alzheimer\u2019s may, in fact, be avoidable. There isn\u2019t a \u201cmind/body connection\u201d; it\u2019s all one!\r\n* On good terms with your kids/family/ex and kind to everyone, regardless of their usefulness to you;)\r\n* In possession of TSA Precheck, know where your car title is, and are, in short, a grown-up.\r\n* Able to laugh at yourself, apologize and accept apologies, and keep things in perspective.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDan   \r\nLinger\r\nSan Francisco\r\nBanker\r\n27 Years Old\r\n\r\n\r\nHit me up!\r\n\t1-847-691-1042 (text please)\r\n\tFacebook\r\n\tInstagram\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\nThe day after my 27th birthday, coming back from a wedding, after having rewatched How I Met Your Mother, I read this article and felt lovesick enough to write a damned biography and persuasive essay to find my counterpart with lady-bits.\r\nGoals\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for, in short, is someone who makes me feel special and who I can make feel special. I\u2019ve done enough work on myself as a person that I\u2019m looking for someone that can help me grow and I can help grow as well. Big believer in chemistry; it either works or it doesn\u2019t work. That being said, I\u2019m a slow-burn and an acquired taste.\r\nHere are some things that drive chemistry for me:\r\n* Genuine interest in life and learning more (no one-word answers or feigning disinterest to seem cool)\r\n* Emotional intelligence. Being able to communicate your thoughts and identify your strengths/shortcomings is hot.\r\n* Similar life views and interests, but different enough that we\u2019re not the same person. Hard to quantify or summarize, but we\u2019ll both know.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Enneagram\r\n\tType 8\r\n\tMyers Briggs\r\n\tINTP\r\n\tQuick need to knows\r\n* Male, straight, monogamous.\r\n* 5\u20199, ~160ish lbs and fairly athletic. Frequent runner/biker.\r\n* Very Liberal policy-wise, but have my limits. \r\n* Raised non-denominational christian, personally non-religious\r\n* Drink 3-5 times a month, generally only there\u2019s an impetus (party, nice dinner,  happy hour, etc.)\r\n* Occasional weed usage. Never have tried anything harder, but could be talked into experimentation.\r\n* Private Banker. I work with HNW/UHNW persons on their unique banking needs, outside of what you\u2019d be able to get from an app or a bank branch. Lots of VC/Tech adjacent people.\r\n* MA in Financial Economics from University of St Andrews (Scotland). Also a CFA Charterholder.\r\n* Kids? I\u2019m mostly on the \u201cno\u201d boat but who knows who or what might change me.\r\nLife Story (the first date drivel)\r\n1. Born and raised in the Chicago Suburbs. Winnetka, if you need to know. If i had to give myself a typecast it would be \u201cthe uncool kid that hung out with the cool kids because they all thought he was genuinely fun\u201d\r\n2. I went to University of St Andrews in Scotland. I studied economics, was a rower (and coach), and generally had a great time being slightly immature but also trying to be sophisticated.\r\n3. I came back to Chicago after graduating, and sold my soul to a bank. I dove in way too deep and became way too much of a recluse while COVID raged. \r\n4. I needed a change and used my bargaining power to find myself a role out in San Francisco. I moved out at the end of 2021 and have been trying to find myself again.\r\nI have two great parents (both work in finance too, I know we suck), an older brother who is outshining me by having a fiance + a dog + a house in Chicago, and always grew up with Golden Retrievers and Corgis (cool ones).\r\nMy Flaunts\r\n1. Not a \u2018dude\u2019\r\n   1. I do yoga occasionally\r\n   2. Love candles\r\n   3. Great at giving opinions on women\u2019s outfits\r\n2. Wide range of skills and knowledge\r\nDrives manual, knowledge of historical events, wide ranging vocabulary, pretty impressive cardio ability.\r\n3. Intellectual prowess\r\n1. 33 ACT (top 1%)\r\n2. Passed CFA program without any re-takes\r\n3. Went to the #1 university in the UK and got a 2:1 degree\r\n4. I\u2019m hilarious both sober and drunk if you get on my level of goofiness\r\n5. Maturity\r\n   1. Emotional Intelligence\r\n   2. Great conversationalist with middle aged people\r\n   3. Able to rationalize my own and other\u2019s actions\r\n6. Passionate and generous lover\r\nMy secret is eye contact and lots of skin contact. Also, it\u2019s good size and it\u2019s got a curve ;)\r\nMy Faults\r\n7. I\u2019m an emotional work in progress\r\nYeah, I have a therapist (shoutout to Linda). At least I admit it!\r\n8. Trouble keeping my thoughts and opinions to myself\r\nMy boss and coworkers love this trait.\r\n9. I can be a cheapskate\r\nTime to confess I have some socks with holes and buy the cheap paper towels (but not toilet paper. I always have good toilet paper).\r\n10. Trouble admitting when I need help\r\nAgain, shoutout to Linda\r\n11. I need to treat myself better\r\n   1. Skincare routine needs work\r\n   2. Don\u2019t get all my fruits/vegetables everyday\r\n   3. I occasionally wear socks with holes in them\r\n12. I\u2019m a stereotype on paper\r\nWorks in finance, lives in the marina, drives a BMW. I make up for this in other ways (see flaunts).\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffTamera\u2019s dating doc\r\nStill endorsed as of Sep 21, 2023 (I\u2019ll try to update at least every two weeks ensure freshness)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn brief\r\nHello! My name is Tamera, pronounced like \u201ccamera\u201d (\ud83d\udcf7) but with a T at the start. I\u2019m a 28-year-old woman (she / her pronouns) who works as an AI alignment researcher and lives in Berkeley, CA. I\u2019m looking for a man, aged ~24-34, who lives in the Bay Area and is looking for a primary, monogam-ish, or monogamous partner.\r\nAbout me\r\nPersonality\r\nTalking about one\u2019s own personality is always kind of a strange thing to do, but despite that I\u2019ll try to give you some flavor for what I\u2019m like!\r\n\r\n\r\n* Curious - I think the world is very strange and interesting, and I like to try to figure out what\u2019s going on. I see interesting questions everywhere and I am rarely satisfied with surface-level answers. Although I love to figure things out, I\u2019m relatively less interested in knowing things, except insofar as they\u2019re instrumentally useful to figuring things out (my favorite thing).\r\n* Silly - I like to laugh, joke, and communicate through humor. I get along best with people who like to banter and lean into the absurd.\r\n* Caring - I care deeply for the people around me, and I love to find ways to make their lives better. I enjoy being cared for in return!\r\n* Quick - I like to think on my feet and have high-bandwidth conversations. I like to be put in unfamiliar environments and figure things out on the fly.\r\n* Weird - Sometimes it takes my friends a long time to figure this out about me (since I\u2019m doing a great job of coming off like a normal person!) but I think the way I approach the world is at core very different from many people. This can be hard to articulate exactly so I suggest that you keep a eye out to try to catch a glimpse of what I mean here.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther adjectives that might be used to describe me include enthusiastic, extroverted, analytical, opinionated, novelty-seeking, and joyful.\r\nCommunity and culture\r\nI\u2019m very much a part of the EA / rationalist culture and most of my friends would identify similarly. I live in a group house with a bunch of people in this community, and it is quite central in my life. It\u2019s great if you\u2019re a part of this world too, but also totally fine if you aren\u2019t!\r\nActivities I enjoy\r\nGenerally an ideal weekday evening for me involves a good conversation with a few friends, or some kind of chill communal activity like a game or film.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also enjoy a constantly-rotating selection of hobbies. Some examples include:\r\n* Hiking / camping / backpacking\r\n* Many different crafts, including woodworking, bookbinding, and making my own backpacking gear\r\n* Plein air watercolor\r\n* Crosswords and other word games\r\n* Playing ukulele (although I am not very good at it)\r\n* Social dance, mostly contra but I\u2019m getting into west coast swing\r\n* Cooking (I used to do this a lot more)\r\n* Silly little home improvement and home automation projects\r\n* All sorts of trips and adventures with friends\r\n\r\n\r\nMany weekend evenings you can find me at some Bay Area house party chatting with a bunch of other AI weirdos like myself. \r\nRomance-specific details\r\n\r\n\r\n* Relationship style - I\u2019ve only ever been in monogamous partnerships, and I have been very happy with that in the past. I\u2019ve never had a serious polyamorous relationship; I\u2019m in the midst of exploring the idea now. I think the ideal for me is probably a deeply loving primary partnership with the freedom for other little flings and romances on the side.\r\n* Kids? - I\u2019m something like 60/40 against. I really like children but I\u2019m not wild about babies, and pregnancy truly freaks me out. I could be down but it\u2019d have to be under the right circumstances. I can honestly see it going either way!\r\n* Religion - I\u2019m not religious but I was raised Jewish. In my own calculus this doesn\u2019t matter much, but maybe to you it does!\r\nThe logistics\r\n\r\n\r\nI know it can be scary to reach out, but I wrote this dating doc because I want to find someone! So I\u2019d encourage you not to filter yourself out if you think there\u2019s a chance we could be a good match. (I am also likely being contacted much less often than you might think!)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, before we proceed, I\u2019d like you to be aware that it usually takes me a while to warm up to someone. I often don\u2019t feel comfortable with someone until I\u2019ve seen them in a number of different contexts and known them for a few weeks at least. If I\u2019m not all-in at first blush, don\u2019t worry, I might just need some time. In the interim I\u2019m likely to casually invite you to various parties and events so I can observe you in the wild so we can get to know each other without too much relationship-escalation pressure. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best way to reach out is by texting me at: (\u202asix two eight) three three three - four seven two seven. Please send me some info about yourself, and we can find a time for a call or casual date. I look forward to hearing from you!",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffThese laundry-list profiles are, in my view, totally beside the point and do not necessarily make for a lasting and fulfilling relationship. What I think does, and what I\u2019d like, is someone who\u2019d like to begin by just entering into a conversation, without a checklist of match-up criteria, just to see what might happen. I\u2019m interested in the person\u2019s mind, how their mind works, what they have to say, what interests them and above all what they say or don\u2019t say in the moment. The thing below is an example of what I had to say at a particular moment, an hour or so ago on August 18, 2023, on a morning when... Which would then segue into whatever was going on in my life and/or mind at that moment that I felt like writing about. I\u2019d like someone else to do the same, and then just maybe there might be a basis for something \u2013 indefinable because whatever it is, will evolve and be created by how we interact, the extent to which we trust each other and sense that each other\u2019s well being is important to us. I know this sounds kind of namby-pamby and vague, but talking about which composers I like or which books I read or what I do in my leisure time and my various careers: would that really tell anyone what they need to know? I suppose you could begin by asking yourself, What do I need to know about this person who\u2019s posted this bizarre, possibly unreadable, probably self indulgent, surely stonewalling, and far too long poor excuse for a profile? I mean: what do I need to know in order to have a conversation with him? Or should I just take the plunge and begin talking to him and see what happens?\r\n\r\n\r\nResponse to someone else\u2019s profile: \r\n\r\n\r\nI liked your profile, as profiles go. Meaning I could never write one like that, and I've been thinking a lot about what I could write, and when I have a moment and am in deep enough despair (just kidding, sort of), I might actually write and post one. But I don't really believe in them. I think people should just do what they would normally do if they met at a party or bar or wherever: Just begin talking and see what happens, which is what I hereby invite you to do. Via email at first, and then if it seems right/appropriate and the like, we can talk via a screen or you can board a plane and take a vacation in Budapest, where I live in a mega leafy neighborhood, magnificent view of the whole city from the terrace, beautiful walks and an interesting building (long story).\r\n\r\n\r\nI am of course kidding about the vacation in Budapest, but, well, you know, you never know. And again, in my experience writing into a vacuum as I am now doing (okay, your photos, which are lovely, and the profile, which I liked) doesn't hold a candle to actual communication. One thing we could try is emailing in real time, as opposed to using a chat platform. Or we could do google meet without the screen, which I find distracting, so it would be a free phone call. Or anything else you'd like to suggest. I do have other suggestions, but I've already said enough, probably too much, being brief isn't exactly my strong point.\r\nAnd as you can see there's very little profile-ish here, about my external life, because as I said, I think people should just write or say whatever they feel like writing/saying as in real life. And I really do invite you to do the same, without worrying about the impression it makes or anything like that. I've actually thought about starting a dating app which, like google docs albeit with a various differences, would encourage and enable people looking for a partner to do just that: just talk to each other, but within a particular structure that I'll elaborate on some other time, if we do end up talking to each other which I hope we do. If you have questions, you can ask, but here's what really interests me about anyone I meet, regardless of gender: how their mind works, what they think about, how interested they are in communicating, I mean passionately interested, and in communicating outside the envelope, if you see what I mean. Okay you don't: I mean just trying forms of communication other than the usual getting to know you sort of thing, to which I admit I'm kind of allergic. For example: sitting in silence (could be done on google meet as well, with or without a screen) and then just saying a few words now and then, but allowing the silence to dominate. That can be very powerful. Or deciding to free associate on any word, concept, name, really could be anything, and deciding on that would in and of itself make for an interesting dialogue. Or asking each other questions, but responding with only one or two words, or with a sound, or with silence (you'd say: silence, and then not answer). All this in the interest of getting beyond and underneath the superficial level of things, which when lived in the States, drove me A. crazy and B. into relative social isolation, apart from contacts through work and a relationship now and then, and that is a very long story for another time, or perhaps for never.\r\nSo I hope to hear from you. I do of course have a smartphone (just got it, didn't have one before two days ago), and the landline number is below.\r\nIphone: +36305676368. It's not on all the time because the battery isn't in great shape, so if you want to call, call the landline (+ 36 1 395 8751) and just tell me to switch it on and I will.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffIntro\r\nWell hi there. Looks like you've stumbled into my \"date-me doc.\" Welcome, please pull up a chair and get comfy while you peruse my ramblings. \r\n\r\nBasics (get your checklist ready)\r\nAge: 39\r\nHeight: 5\u20194\u201d\r\nLocation: Manhattan, NYC\r\nBuild: Curvy/Athletic\r\nHair: Auburn with blue/green on the back half of my head. It\u2019s a cool girl \u201cmullet\u201d\r\nEyes: Green\r\nEducation: BA in Creative Writing/Poetry, minor in Film Studies\r\nJob: Pricing and Yield management, SiriusXM/Pandora Media (left AND right brained!)\r\nRelationship stats: Never married, looking for monogamous marriage/partnership\r\nKids: No (human) children, but want.\r\nAutobiographical Ramblings (oh, god, you want to know more??)\r\nI am a born and bred New Yorker. Yes, we exist. Yes, I know how to drive (current Kadi model comes with a bonus car accessory!). Yes, I regularly get out of the city because I know the world is broader than 5 boroughs. I plan on staying in the city since my family and friends are here, and I own my apartment.\r\n\r\n\r\nI share my apartment with a tiny furry dictator who throws tantrums when he's not getting enough attention, but is somehow cute enough that I haven't returned him to the shelter. His name is Captain Ignatius, or Iggy if you're a friend (you probably are; he's a belly rub whore).\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been an athlete most of my life (softball, swimming and water polo) and still remain active (kickboxing, gym, rec softball in the park). I love getting lost in a great book or TV show, I geek out on history (NYC history in particular) and 35mm photography. I've traveled some but want to see a lot more of the world, and I'm passionate about human rights of all kinds (LGBTQ, Women's, Black Lives Matter) and animal rights. It is important that my partner understands and supports these as well. I volunteer weekly. I went to a private school in NYC (and hate myself a little bit for having just typed that), and a small liberal arts college upstate. My mother's family is Jewish, but I view that as my culture and not my religion. I\u2019m an atheist. I don't care if you have religion in your life as long as you don't try to convert me or impose it on our life together. \r\n\r\n\r\nI drink and am 420 friendly. I do not smoke cigarettes or cigars and will not date someone who does. I am fairly liberal, so conservatives need not apply. I think common sense is not so common anymore, particularly when it comes to political dogma. I am also always open to thoughtful conversations and debates on most things, so an exact alignment of all my specific values is not a necessity. Respect and morality, however, are.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friends would describe me as sarcastic, funny, \u201cstupid smart\u201d[1], loyal, inquisitive, able to name most actors and at least two TV shows/movies they've been in, and \"the reason I have a beauty product addiction.\"[2] And, my personal favorite: \u201cI'm trying to figure out a way to say \"loud and opinionated\" in a way that doesn't sound like an insult\u201d[3]\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for (hey, that could be you!)\r\nWhat I am looking for is a partner in the truest sense of the word. A man with whom I can share my life (and who shares his with me), have a child, see the world, and do all the things. I don't have a laundry list of qualifications, but someone who is settled enough in his life that he's ready to be serious and settle down is important. Non-smoker, non-conservative, not very religious. Able to keep up with my random thoughts, preferably sharing some interests, and willing to also let the furry dictator into your life (we\u2019re a package deal). \r\nI would prefer a man who\u2019s at least 5\u20198\u201d, between 30 and 45, who is based in the NYC area (5 boroughs ideally)\r\nStill here? \r\nYou can reach me at DateKadi@gmail.com, and please include either your own doc or basic details (age, height, where you live, some photos (or social handles)) and what drew you to reach out. I don\u2019t have the ability to answer every email, but I do my best. My socials are locked, and I don\u2019t add randos, sorry! \r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos!\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, you want pictures of ME?? Keep scrolling! \r\n  \r\n          \r\n  \r\n         \r\n________________\r\n[1] Best friend #1\r\n[2] Best friend #1\r\n[3] Best friend #2",

I work to live, not live to work. \r\n* I\u2019m an introverted lady that won\u2019t stop talking if it\u2019s a conversation about evaluating all the easter eggs about a movie or TV show (after watching Barbie, I went down a Ryan Gosling tunnel and watched Blue Valentine, The Place Beyond the Pines, Crazy Stupid Love, Gangster Squad, and The Notebook, just as a rational person would lol)\r\n* My love language is quality time!

The ability to walk and explore wherever they live.   \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for in a person:    \r\n   * A person who can be silly and goofy with me  \r\n   * Mental health is very important to me.

I am not a social media person or a party person. I enjoy the quiet moments and occasions with a small, tight group of friends. You will not find me at the club or going on Instagram live lol.\r\n      * Has a stable career and goals for their life. \r\n      * Knows they are whole and seeks another whole person, together being a team\r\n      * Would want children one day",

I am a librarian and really enjoy my profession; I especially enjoy coordinating talks with authors. I love watching old movies, reading, going for hikes, traveling, trying new restaurants and being an uncle (my adorable niece is pictured with me below!). Some of my favorite travel destinations are Montreal, San Francisco and New Orleans. Anxiously looking to explore Europe! I also have learned to enjoy New England and the Northeast and have enjoyed going on trips to Providence, the Catskill Mountains,  Salem and the Berkshires. \r\n\r\n\r\n        What I\u2019m Looking for:\r\n\r\n\r\nI am looking for a monogamous relationship with someone who is located in the Connecticut area. I am looking for someone who has a sense of humor, is family oriented, shares similar interests, is looking to have children, has a desire to travel and go on adventures, but is also comfortable just staying in and watching movies. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nFeel free to contact: jtcoutts@gmail.com \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching : \r\nhttps://letterboxd.com/siakams_razor/\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12285263-jeff",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHi there, I'm Eduardo!\r\nI'm a 27-year-old man doing my PhD in Astrophysics. Yup, I love the stars, but don't worry, I won't bore you with space facts unless you're really into that. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few things about me:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I'm Latino, and stand at about 1.73 meters ( 5'8\").\r\n* I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs. I've got no issues if you like a drink now and then, though.\r\n* I'm mostly a pescatarian, but I also enjoy eating chicken occasionally; I cut out red meat a long time ago.\r\n* I\u2019m looking for a genuine, monogamous connection with a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m into:\r\n\r\n\r\n* I care about social and climate justice, and I\u2019m especially passionate about helping students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM.\r\n* Environmentally conscious: I do not own a car, so I always bike to places. I try to conserve water and electricity, and I've taken a recent liking to train travels.\r\n* Outdoors is my jam: hiking, kayaking, zip-lining\u2014you name it!\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Swimming\u2014it's my go-to relaxation.\r\n* Playing the guitar.\r\n* Cooking and experimenting with recipes.\r\n* Hiking and exploring trails.\r\n* Always up to try different cuisines!\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I appreciate in a partner:\r\nI value intelligence, kindness, and someone supportive. Not looking for academic accolades, just someone who's passionate about their work, has a good laugh, and genuinely enjoys helping others and making a positive impact on the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust so you know:\r\nIf we hit it off and decide to meet, maybe we could have a fun story for how we met? Something other than \"online\" \u2014 like meeting at a crowded library while reaching for the same book on quantum mechanics. But hey, that's just a thought!\r\nFeel free to shoot me an email at elihumunguia7@gmail.com",

I describe myself as deeply curious about the world with a drive to make a positive impact. I'm seeking a long-term relationship with a woman who shares a similar curiosity and drive. Open to long-distance dating and periodic travel. Please connect me with any women you feel might be a good match. Thank you!\r\nHey! This is Swami\u2019s dating document. It was inspired from numerous other docs here. If anyone recognizes the format or specific phrases, please consider it a nod to your originality! I mean, they do say that imitation is the best form of flattery, right? \ud83d\ude1b Whenever I've borrowed a line directly with minimal modifications, I've made a note of it in brackets. Also, pardon me for making the doc incredibly long (and serious?). I\u2019ve tried to arrange things with sub-headings/headings to help you navigate it. I hope it helps. And happy to receive feedback on how I could improve this doc! Over time, I\u2019ll probably also try to make it shorter and more fun to read \ud83d\ude43. \r\nContents\r\n* Personality\r\n* Interests\r\n* Career and Passions\r\n* Work in progress\r\n* Dating Preferences\r\n* Other imp stuff - kids/relationship style etc\r\n* Possible cons or sources of incompatibility \r\n* How to Connect with Me\r\nPersonality\r\nThis section could feel like a drag to read. So I would recommend skimming/reading the headings first and then deciding whether to read the corresponding descriptions.\r\nFamily and Friends - A Sense of Duty and Affection: Stereotypically Indian in this respect. \r\nTeamwork and Partnership: I thrive under collaborative settings, both in professional and personal settings. However, until a few years back I didn\u2019t appreciate the value of collaborative exploration in personal settings. Covid thankfully changed that by forcing me into a 1.5 year long coliving experiment with my then wonderful housemates and making me realize the value of deep personal relationships. Ever since I\u2019ve tried to keep the spirit alive. I have as a result built some of my closest friendships and had immense personal growth along dimensions I had mostly considered pointless until then!\r\nConventionally sociable with unconventional interests and aspirations : While my youthful 'weirdness' defined my unique interests, maturity has woven this individuality into a tapestry of approachable and meaningful connections. I thrive on the balance between maintaining my quirks and fostering genuine interactions, embodying a blend of individuality and sociability that defines me.\r\nA Compassionate World View: That doesn't necessarily mean I\u2019m unusually empathetic, or unusually self-sacrificing. But there\u2019s an underlying attitude of valuing things outside of oneself that makes prosocial behavior feel less like an imposition and more like a facet of one\u2019s own desires or personality. To care in this sense is to want to sculpt a better version of the world into existence. (partial copy)\r\nEmotional range : While my external emotional display is adept at adapting to those around me, internally, my personal emotional spectrum can be more nuanced. I seldom feel sadness or anger or depression, and even my moments of genuine joy and excitement come in subtler shades \u2014 maybe my time with robots is rubbing off on me \ud83d\ude09! Although that describes my natural state, in environments where I feel at ease, I can consciously dial up the vibrancy of my emotions, embracing a more exuberant demeanor. In contrast, unfamiliar situations demand so much cognitive bandwidth that modulating my internal emotional response becomes challenging. \r\nCuriosity+learning : Stereotypical PhD student/researcher. When a topic piques my interest, it's easy for me to get lost in a book or get lost in deep explorations, diving into their intricate details. I relish sharing and discussing these explorations with friends, family, and colleagues. \r\nThrive on conversations: Related to the above point, I learn and think best through conversations. This is how I A/B test my ideas/thoughts, filter confirmation biases and generate new ideas! And I like to talk about/discuss almost anything under the sun, especially when it\u2019s new territory or something I haven\u2019t thought enough about already!\r\nPeople pleaser : Standard stuff - Have a hard time saying no or confronting people. \r\nInsecurities/Personal challenges: \r\n* Although I love to talk about my interests/explorations, I have a constant insecurity that the listener is getting bored. Partly stems from the fact that the average person does indeed get bored lol. The only way to improve is to get better at using feedback.\r\n* My work is a significant part of my identity. I frequently have \u2018midlife\u2019 crises about the social utility of my work. I am in a constant tug-of-war with myself over how to trade-off between more socially meaningful things vs intellectually interesting pursuits.\r\n* Navigating Social Dynamics: Deciding how to best allocate my time among friends, family, and professional obligations is an ongoing challenge. The difficulty in saying no or prioritizing one over the other often leads to existential quandaries.\r\n* And then the standard things - fear of rejection, failure, judgment etc. \r\nOther personality quirks : \r\n* I often have strong opinions but they are also pretty weakly held (i.e I love to change my mind). I pride myself on being open-minded, but I'll admit, I sometimes wrestle with confirmation biases. Conversations have been my best tool to tackle them. I\u2019ve gotten better at it over time, but it\u2019s always a work in progress.\r\n* I love gossip! But I\u2019m not great at keeping secrets \ud83d\ude4a. While I strive to be a vault for serious secrets, the fun ones might just slip out in a playful conversation. Yet, my friends still find me a worthy confidante. Go figure! \ud83d\ude09\r\n* Instinctively I\u2019m a minimalist and like to keep my footprint low. I typically don\u2019t buy things unless it feels necessary. It\u2019s not some strong ideological commitment. Just something I picked up during my childhood. \r\n* I consume very healthy food, largely thanks to my taste buds not caring about taste very much.. Haha.\r\n* I love summer! Winter not so much. Yet I\u2019ve spent 6+ years in Pittsburgh \ud83d\ude05. \r\n* Lastly, I love to make fun of myself (as you might notice from this document) as well as the people around me. Given that I do plenty of dumb things, folks typically find sufficient material to make fun of me.. Haha.\r\nThere are likely many more of these, but I will spare you the rest. I believe that should provide you with a general sense of the tedium you might be getting yourself into! \ud83d\ude1b\r\nInterests\r\n* Learning/Intellectual Curiosity : I'm quite curious about the world and enjoy exploring topics that help me understand it better. This can range from the finer points of economics and the dynamic landscape of geopolitics, to the evolving landscape of startups or the intricacies of historical and sociological phenomena. Lately, I've been delving into the following :\r\n   * Economics : Good Economics for Hard Times, Slouching towards Utopia\r\n   * The power of networks : MegaNets, The power law\r\n   * Impact of AI on society : The coming wave\r\n   * Religious history : A little history of Religion, God Human Animal Machine.\r\n   * Self Improvement : Atomic Habits, Stolen Focus\r\n   * General History : Hard Core History podcast, Age of revolutions, End times, The dawn of everything\r\n   * Geopolitics : The avoidable war, The end of the world Is just the beginning\r\n* Hanging out with friends and chatting : In fact that\u2019s one of the reasons I love academia. We spend most of the day chatting and fooling around, even (especially?) during work hours \ud83d\ude02. (and then finally get some work done at night when no one\u2019s around.. This dating doc was a casualty of some of those late-night sessions)\r\n* Physical Activities: My go-to sources for weekly exercise are running, biking, and gymming, preferably with friends.\r\nThings I\u2019m curious about and want to explore\r\n* Book Clubs/Curius App  (social reading/bookmark tool) - Was introduced to the Curius app while going through someone else\u2019s dating doc and have since been using it. Social reading/bookmarking sounds amazing. I definitely want to start using it more! More broadly, I\u2019d love to turn my reading/ listening into a social activity using Curius or by reading jointly with groups of friends.\r\n* Blog writing : I\u2019ve also been meaning to convert a lot of my thoughts into blogs both for personal reference and to disseminate a lot of the thoughts out to the world. But I\u2019ve just been procrastinating on that. Would love to have a partner in crime for this! Here\u2019s a list of topics I\u2019ve been thinking/reading about : Blogs Topic List\r\nCareer & Passions\r\nI\u2019m a PhD student at CMU working at the intersection of optimization and deep learning with applications in Robotics. I started working on it mostly out of intellectual curiosity and felt proud of it, assuming that it will pave the way towards a more productive and prosperous future. However, the recent rapid advancements in the field have spurred some introspection. I now feel there\u2019s a reasonable risk of unfettered progress also leading to societal instability and chaos. Hence, I have been reconsidering my research directions and trying to pivot towards specific applications that have potential to create new markets and industries that complement, rather than just displace, human labor. This has led me to exciting domains like space robotics, human robot coordination etc. \r\nOutside the realm of academia, I'm driven by the urge to adapt our societal structures in anticipation of rapid technological shifts. I have several thoughts on evolving our socioeconomic systems, and designing modern institutions and communities fit for the AI/digital age. I already spend a significant amount of time thinking about them, but I'm keen on exploring these more deeply/working on them soon, perhaps post-PhD. If our paths align or if you're curious about such dialogues (or fancy a spirited chat on UBI vs. micro-credits and how tech could help scale them. I personally prefer the latter), let's discuss! haha\r\nWork in progress\r\n* Crafting my own path : I have had a tendency since the very beginning to be \u201cdifferent\u201d. Defy the local mainstream. Until a few years back, the \u2018defiant\u2019 paths I chose also had reasonably clear trails that I could follow. However, my more recent \u2018defiant\u2019 interests are far less explored and lack clear trails. Currently I\u2019m trying to figure out a reasonable path forward. \r\n* Improving conversational skills : While I\u2019ve improved a lot in making conversations, there\u2019s still a long way to go. Eg I\u2019m still bad at (a) Pausing and appreciating other people\u2019s arguments (b) Simultaneously reasoning about the arguments in the current discussion and steering the broader direction of the discussion at a meta level (b) conversing with multiple people at once (c) communicating effectively under stress (d) messaging convos, etc. (in summary, bad at multithreading)\r\n* Emotional range - As touched upon in the personality section, my internal emotional range is a bit muted. I\u2019m working on enriching it, especially on the positive spectrum.\r\n* Becoming more digital native - I\u2019m a millennial who\u2019s a bit wary of having a strong digital social presence (I know, we\u2019re a rare breed, but we do exist \ud83d\ude1b). But I\u2019m trying to shake it. Blog writing/Cirius usage would probably help. \r\n* Prioritization skills - (a) get better at saying No to things (b) stop doom scrolling and reading arbitrary things. (c) make strict schedules and stick to it.\r\nWhat am I looking for in a partner?\r\nI\u2019m listing some of the qualities that I absolutely love in people. But none of these obviously are requirements.  \r\n* Curiosity + intellectual excitement : There\u2019s nothing I enjoy more in life than trying to learn and understand new things with someone!\r\n* Deeply cares about the world and wants to make it better : I have a deep sense of appreciation and respect for people who genuinely care about the world!\r\n* Unconventional/weird : I have a huge admiration for people defying the mainstream and venturing into the unknown (especially for social good reasons). \r\n* And then there\u2019s the usual stuff like vibe match etc. which we\u2019ll figure out over time.\r\nOther important stuff:\r\n* Location: I\u2019m a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, and I expect to graduate mid 2025ish. \r\n   * I could possibly travel to another city periodically given my PhD doesn\u2019t have a strong place constraint.\r\n   * And I would be more than happy to date long-distance!\r\n* Relationship style: Monogamous.\r\n* Kids: I love children and would like to have (or adopt) kids. In particular, I\u2019m excited to have children with someone. It goes back to the notion of teamwork and shared deep connection that parenting facilitates. In fact, I\u2019m hoping we also develop tools in the process that make parenting more communal for everyone. I think kids are the best source of entertainment and meaning adults get and I want to share it with everyone! Likewise, I think kids learn a lot from interacting with a diverse set of adults! So it is a win-win for everyone!\r\n   * That being said, our mutual understanding and discussions will play a pivotal role in shaping this decision (even of having kids)! If you prefer other ways we could get a shared sense of meaning and connection, I would definitely be open to that possibility as well! \r\nPossible \u2018cons\u2019 or sources of incompatibility (beyond what you might have already inferred from above):\r\n* Balancing Time: I\u2019m generally bad at prioritizing and balancing my time. I let whatever gets my attention drive my priorities. It does work well in certain cases when I carefully tune my environment so that my attention is consumed by people/activities I care about. But sometimes it can get difficult when I need to redirect my focus since changing the environment isn\u2019t easy. I can also sometimes overcommit to too many things, which occasionally itself causes a juggle in balancing my time. \r\n* Relationship Experience: I've never tried dating before!! For a long time, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted from a relationship and thought I could get most things I cared about through friendships. My opinions there changed a few years back. But then covid happened and then life happened\ud83d\ude02. Also, I don\u2019t like the format that most dating apps offer, and the leap from friendship to romance has always felt daunting. So, I think dating docs really were a saving grace for me both in terms of timing and style! I don\u2019t think I had any chance of dating someone without it (maybe I still don\u2019t, we\u2019ll see \ud83d\ude02 ).  \r\nUpdate : Dating doc was a partial success \ud83d\ude1b . Now, I can say I have dated people!\r\n* Not an activities person: Whether in a small cafe or on a long trip, it's the engaging conversations that I cherish the most, rather than the activities themselves. So I usually prefer activities that are in the service of conversations/chats!\r\n* Dietary Habits: I identify as a \"fuzzy vegan\" (some friends prefer to call me \"fake-vegan\" instead \ud83d\ude09). While I prefer being vegan, there are occasions where I indulge in milk or egg-based products for social/my own convenience.\r\n   * I would be happy to date someone who isn\u2019t vegan/vegetarian though, we would just have some extra cooking to do :) (copied)\r\n   * Lifestyle Choices: I avoid alcohol, smoking, and drugs. However, I'd very much enjoy a partner who enjoys a drink now and then.\r\n   * Family Dynamics: My dad deals with minor mental health issues which occasionally influence our family dynamics. Thanks to effective medication, such instances are mostly under control now. We've also learned to support and uplift each other effectively through these times. I mention this for the sake of transparency and believe it shouldn't be a cause for concern.\r\n   * Taste in Music/Dance/Art: I have a somewhat narrow taste in music! And my dancing skills are completely hopeless! My sense of aesthetics and art is better but not great by any means unfortunately! \ud83d\ude05\r\n   * MOST IMPORTANTLY : I EAT A LOT \ud83d\ude02.  Dining out with me might turn into a patience test for my company!!! \r\nWhat could we do together?\r\n   * Mutual Learning: My top pick! Let\u2019s immerse ourselves in new subjects, teach each other, or delve into engaging books or podcasts. The exchange of ideas is the thrill!\r\n   * Social Gatherings: Spending time with our respective friends is a great way to blend our worlds and share experiences.\r\n   * walks/runs/biking/hikes: Go on walks/runs/biking/hikes and talk or just look at some good ol\u2019 trees\u2026 \ud83c\udf32(copied)\r\n   * Collaborative Projects: Some examples from the \u2018interests\u2019 section above include writing blogs together or perhaps starting a podcast! I would also absolutely love to work on a project or try out a new area together.\r\n   * Day-to-Day Delights: The magic is often in the mundane. Activities like cooking or exercising become special when done together!\r\nIf you think we might be compatible or just have some comments, please reach out!\r\n   * Thanks for making it all the way to the end of my document! I already admire your attention span and curiosity! Please leave me a message in this google form if you want to stay in touch or have any comments or suggestions for me! If you think we\u2019re compatible and are interested in dating, please fill out this google form to let me know \ud83d\ude42. And if you don\u2019t like the format of a google form, feel free to mention that in the comments form and we can try to arrange a call instead!",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate Me ;) \r\nHi! I\u2019m Kyleigh, a 30-year-old woman in Southern California. I\u2019m looking for a long term partner. \r\nI recently came across the concept of a Date Me Doc, and I was intrigued. So, let\u2019s find out what happens when I tell the universe exactly what I want. \u2728\r\nDIRECTORY\r\n\u2192Get to know me\r\n\u2192What I\u2019m looking for\r\n\u2192Want to date me? \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\nGet to know me\r\n* Corporate by day, I\u2019m a senior manager of external communications for a Fortune 100 company. I take pride in being a leader of people and developing my team and our culture, while enhancing my brand\u2019s reputation through storytelling (in a nutshell). Work keeps me fairly busy during the week. \r\n* In my spare time, I practice yoga, hang out with my rescue pup, Tayla, practice self-care and mindfulness, spend time with close friends, enjoy the outdoors, and the occasional trash tv binge. Note: I do not consider myself to be a chronically online person \u2013 in fact, I make conscious effort to spend less time behind screens.\r\n* I\u2019ve been single for nearly two years, and it\u2019s been ages since I\u2019ve had a serious long term relationship. I\u2019ve dated here and there, but I\u2019m not interested in wasting time with anyone I don\u2019t feel a genuine connection with. I\u2019m quite independent, and I spend a decent amount of time alone, which I don\u2019t usually mind. I go to therapy regularly, and I\u2019m continually working to make my anxious attachment style more secure. I\u2019m ready for a conscious relationship with someone who isn\u2019t afraid to do the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2192 Things I\u2019m Into\r\n* Camping, road trips, national parks, mountains and other lowkey outdoorsy shit.\r\n* Growth, self-development and manifestation. \r\n* A good book with nothing to do and nowhere to be.\r\n* Warm baths/showers by candlelight.\r\n* Dogs and animals in general. I rescued a 50-pound super mutt, and she\u2019s my bestie/adventure buddy.\r\n* My cozy apartment/safe haven. I like creating comfortable, warm spaces and taking care of my home. \r\n* All things cheese, charcuterie and wine. I won\u2019t say no to being wined and dined. \r\n* Crystals, incense, journaling, moon rituals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2192 My Strengths\r\n* My empathy \u2013 I have a huge heart, and I can be a sensitive girlie. It\u2019s a superpower and a curse.\r\n* My open-mindedness and ability to see multiple/opposing points of view.\r\n* I\u2019ve built a great life for myself. I\u2019m self-sufficient and fairly successful. I\u2019m enjoying this phase of life I\u2019m in, but I also have a growth mindset and am always evolving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2192 My Dreams\r\n* Quit my job and make a living off of my hobbies (just not sure which ones yet).\r\n* Travel and see as much of the world (and eat as many different foods) as I can.\r\n* Find a partner to grow through life with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2192 Some Basics\r\n* Height: 5\u20198\u201d\r\n* Sexuality: Bi+ (past LTRs with men, but attracted to men and women)\r\n* Diet: Omnivore foodie\r\n* Drinking: Sometimes, mostly wine or cocktails with friends\r\n* Smoking: Never, and I don\u2019t date people who smoke cigarettes\r\n* Drugs: Weed occasionally in the evenings to unwind \r\n* Zodiac: \u2600\ufe0fGemini \ud83c\udf19 Pisces  \u2b06\ufe0f Cancer \r\n* Tats: A few small ones ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2192 Lifestyle + Views\r\n* Kids: I\u2019m open to having kids (not a dealbreaker either way), but no time soon and the circumstances would need to be just right.\r\n* Religion: Not religious, but I consider myself \u201cspiritual\u201d in my own unique relationship with higher power.\r\n* Political views: I enjoy having open-minded conversations with thoughtful people, but I don\u2019t consider myself political. I think the bipartisan system is a distraction, and I don\u2019t really identify with a party. \r\n* Causes I care about: Women\u2019s/reproductive rights. LGBTQ+ rights. Living a somewhat environmentally conscious lifestyle. Animal welfare/adopt don\u2019t shop. \r\n* Activity: As previously mentioned, I\u2019m a bit of a yogi. My physical activity hasn\u2019t been much lately beyond yoga and long walks with my dog due to a long-term strain/injury, but I recently got back into circuit training. I also enjoy hiking and kickboxing (though I\u2019m v new to the latter).\r\n* Relationship Type: Monogamous; I don\u2019t like sharing.\r\n* Marriage: Yes, as in the conscious practice between two people who co-create life together. I don\u2019t really envision a big white wedding. More of an intimate destination wedding or mountain elopement type. \r\n* I am NOT a morning person by nature. I usually wake around 7 a.m. and sleep around 11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2192 My Intrinsic Values (according to clearthinking.org)\r\n* Agency/freedom \u2013 that I can make choices for myself\r\n* Learning/knowing \u2013 that I continually learn new things\r\n* Virtue/embodiment \u2013  that I maintain my humility and gratitude\r\n* Pleasure/experiences \u2013 that I experience pleasure and my life is full of exciting things\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2192Photos\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m Looking For\r\n* Energy \u2013 I want that deep, soul-level connection with someone funny, warm and joyful. I also need someone who wants to put energy in and shows up.\r\n* Ambition, goals and growth mindset.\r\n* Someone good, kind and open-minded with quiet confidence and strong boundaries. \r\n* Emotional intelligence/awareness and someone who can speak my love languages.\r\n* Genuine curiosity for me and my world, deep/close connections with loved ones and a conscious self-care practice that includes mind, body and soul. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u2192 The kinda relationship I want\r\n* Communication is healthy, open and abundant; my love languages are words of affirmation and quality time/quality conversation. \r\n* I\u2019m a highly sexual person, (from what I gather, more so than than the average woman) and I need someone who matches my level of desire/drive.\r\n* We respect each other\u2019s individuality, and together, we co-create a thriving life and challenge each other to be better versions of ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWanna date me?\r\nIf this piques your interest \u2013 or you know someone who it might \u2013 I\u2019d love to hear from you. Get in touch right here.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffMe: Prasad Vangala\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Me: To start with, I spend most of my time on Web Series (I love periodic dramas like Downton Abbey, Outlander, Bridgerton, The Crown etc.., - I always wonder how things would were in the past), also movies (I love Sci-fi movies - My all time fav is Interstellar and a huge fan of Christopher Nolan) and sports (I grew up in India, so I love Cricket and I also love Football (European), Tennis, Badminton, WWE & recently fell in love with Basketball and getting the hang of Baseball. So, summarize, Web Series, Movies & Sports (mostly). Also, I am a Chartered Accountant (Equivalent to US CPA / UK ACCA) - Nerd and not a Nerd too. As much as I love studying, I like to keep distance between my personal and professional life. I am kind, trying to make a career in the USA. I left my family in India, because it's my dream to study and work in the USA. I completed my masters in ASU and started my full time job with Deloitte in their Audit Team. I love Indian Food and would love to try other cuisines too. I am a vegetarian btw, but don\u2019t mind dating the opposite.

My name is Ravi. I\u2019m a 27-year-old man who works as an Analyst. I\u2019m looking for a woman, who is honest & loving and is looking for a primary partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\nPersonality\r\nTalking about one\u2019s own personality is always kind of a strange thing to do, but despite that I\u2019ll try to give you some flavor for what I\u2019m like!\r\n\r\n\r\n* Curious - I think the world is very strange and interesting, and I like to try to figure out what\u2019s going on. I see interesting questions everywhere and I am rarely satisfied with surface-level answers.\r\n* Silly - I like to laugh, joke, and communicate through humor. I get along best with people who can lean into the absurd.\r\n* Caring - I care deeply for the people around me, and I love to find ways to make their lives better. I enjoy being cared for in return!\r\n* Quick - I like to think on my feet and have high-bandwidth conversations. I like to be put in unfamiliar environments and figure things out on the fly.\r\n* Weird - Sometimes it takes my friends a long time to figure this out about me (since I\u2019m doing a great job of coming off like a normal person!) but I think the way I approach the world is at core very different from many people. This can be hard to articulate exactly so I suggest that you keep an eye out to try to catch a glimpse of what I mean here.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther adjectives that might be used to describe me include enthusiastic, extroverted, analytical, opinionated, traveller, and jolly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities I enjoy\r\n\r\nGenerally involves a good conversation with a few friends, or some activity like a game or film.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also enjoy a constantly-rotating selection of hobbies. Some examples include:\r\n* Hiking / camping / backpacking\r\n* Many different crafts, including woodworking, and making my own backpacking gear\r\n* Playing Guitar(although I am not very good at it)\r\n* All sorts of trips and adventures with friends\r\n* Photography & cinematography is what I crave for \r\n\r\n\r\nRomance-specific details\r\n\r\n\r\n* Relationship style - I\u2019ve only ever been in monogamous partnerships, and I have been very happy with that in the past. I\u2019ve never tried polyamory, and I\u2019m not opposed to the concept, but I\u2019d definitely need some hand-holding if I were to try it.\r\n* Kids? - I really like children but I\u2019m not wild about babies. I could be down but it\u2019d have to be under the right circumstances. I can honestly see it going either way!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best way to reach out is by mailing me at: roshanraviraj@gmail.com , OR, \r\nInstagram: @roshanstrikes and we can find a time for a call or casual date. I look forward to hearing from you!",

I will not understand someone who is not inquisitive about discovering new landscapes, people, cultures. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Personality: I am versatile. A perfect weekend for me would be biking around the city, walking around a park, watching movies, and choosing a particularly complicated recipe to make.

I am someone who can see beauty in everything, who is amazed very easily, who would genuinely be marveled by anything related to science and nature and I love being in this constant state of wonder, it is just who I am. \r\n\r\n\r\n* In a relationship: I am genuinely looking for a serious relationship, I like being taken care of and I do take care of my partner.  I like to think that I bring joy with my energy and happiness. I have a tremendous sense of empathy and I am great at communicating. I would like to believe that I eloquently share my feelings and that I will both push us to be the best of us. \r\n\r\n\r\nWho Are You ?\r\n* On resume :  You are a straight man who is 27 years old or older, you are above or 5\u20199, you are monogamous and you do not have kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Personality: You are a genuinely good person, you are emotionally intelligent, you are open to the idea of changing and evolving with your partner, you like taking care of your partner, you think life is beautiful, you are a bit traditional, you are empathic and caring, you like cuddling, walking and walking.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHi, I\u2019m Nate! I\u2019m 23, straight, and male. I\u2019m excited about finding an in-person community of people similarly enthusiastic about intellectual exploration. I love talking, hanging out in groups, and coordinating outings. Favorite activities include meeting friends at the park to invent random games involving tennis balls and frisbees, LAN parties, and foraging for wild foods. I just finished school, and I\u2019m very location-agnostic. I\u2019ll likely prioritize learning instead of full time work for the next year or two, although I\u2019m open to reconsidering in order to date someone in an expensive area. Longevity is on my mind a lot, and I\u2019ll probably end up in the field or earning to give to it. I\u2019m currently unsure about having kids. However, I definitely want rationalism and my weird little culture to spread. \r\n\r\n\r\nI was brought up as an atheist and ancap, though I\u2019m pretty agnostic about political philosophy now. Metaethics is a different story: I scrapped the remnants of deontology that I inherited, and I\u2019m now a staunch non-cognitivist. However, I still feel an aversion to coercion. Separating children from their mothers and preventing them from spending most of their day playing outside and otherwise doing whatever they find interesting seems pretty horrific to me. I\u2019m very inclined toward unschooling and aristocratic tutoring. \r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m open to polyamory and experimental relationship structures. I\u2019m not a jealous person anyway, but I\u2019m interested in seeing how novel situations affect me emotionally. I think about the evolution of emotions a lot, though that\u2019s one of the many areas where I get caught in analysis loops and should be more empirical! On that note, I\u2019m open to all sorts of lifestyle experiments. I\u2019m big on Crocker\u2019s rules, but I\u2019ve become very interested in discussing emotions in recent years. I\u2019m prone to existential melancholy and can be a bit dramatic, but I\u2019m not proud of it, and I\u2019m getting better at staying in a good mood consistently. I like snuggling. I haven\u2019t been big on gift-giving or unsolicited acts of service in the past, but I want to improve if that\u2019s your thing!  \r\n\r\n\r\nBesides cold, dry air-induced asthma and mild pet allergies, I\u2019m healthy as a horse. I\u2019m neurotypical but get along well with certain brands of autists. I love outdoor activities and playing sports, though you don\u2019t have to.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can contact me at natestrum@rocketmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some recent pics:",

Hopefully if you know a boy i would like to touch with this will help you identify him.\r\nThings I want that most boys don\u2019t have, roughly in order of how many boys they filter out and by how important/dealbreakery they are\r\n*open to kids maybe??? and probably doesn\u2019t already have kids/strong life commitments\r\n*financially stable, bonus points for having more money than me\r\n*independent, not looking to spend all their time joined at hip\r\n*l i b e r t a r i a n  v i b e s\r\n*social power roughly within an order of magnitude of mine, tho doesn\u2019t need to be same sphere\r\n*is open to risk, brave, caution is calculated, doesn\u2019t let fear of bad outcomes affect taking life by the balls\r\n*sexually sinister\r\n*real good at [jazzhands] emotional maturity: stuff like detecting and naming emotions, having boundaries and a body, communication, \u201ctalking from the stomach\u201d, circling skills, mind meldy moves, speaking-from-poetry-instead-of-accuracy\r\n*similar IQ range, which is higher than average but probably not as high as we\u2019d hope\r\n*not boring? I am deeply, profoundly bored by most humans. Everyone is deeply ok as they are I just prefer to spend my time doing puzzles, which are more interesting than most humans. \r\n*accepting of self and others, at peace\r\n*good at (or at least compatible with/tolerant of) rationality n stuff, cold culture, happy to exchange money for social things, not easily horrified\r\nhow i\u2019m poly\r\n(full-ass post here)\r\nPolyamory is very much mandatory for me, unless you\u2019re a billionaire, because i am down to accept money in exchange for social things. For me, \u201cpoly\u201d just means \u201cI don\u2019t place rules on the intimacy my partner has with others.\u201d In practice, I tend to behave mostly romantically monogamously (prob due to lack of sufficient options i\u2019m interested in), and I have a whole lot of casual sex and am happy to help my partners have casual sex too. I historically have been very helpful for connecting my partners with other women interested in them!\r\n\r\nIm happy to commit time/effort to joint stuff like potential kids or house or \u2018relationship development time\u2019, even if it interrupts potential future relationships with other partners.\r\nAbout Me?\r\nThe list of aella-facts is maybe less necessary cause i exhibitionist my personality loudly online into every crevice, but if you want an external list of nice things, my now-casual partner Nate Soares has a document originally entitled \u201cMy ex is a shit eating whore\u201d which is literally true but google thought he was trying to be mean so it\u2019s now reuploaded here, where he tells people why i am good to date.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd for things about me that are maybe more nonobvious potential dealbreakers for people with specific preferences \r\n\r\n*80% cold culture\r\n*however, can embarrassingly lose all skills when emotionally activated\r\n*messy, horribly, tragically messy, but fortunately i am happy to exchange money for social things\r\n*errs on the side of avoidant\r\n*constantly dealing with stalkers you will have to protect me from\r\n*i do not like directly initiating sex almost ever (tho doesnt mean you cant have as much sex as you want)\r\n*despite playboy once describing me as having the \u2018body of a thoroughbred stallion\u2019, in practice i am gremlinesque, have computerneck, shower infrequently, and i sweat way more than normal and have very erratic poops\r\n*not even the most basic cooking skills\r\n*i like being on the computer a whole lot and dont like doing much outside stuff\r\n*not routine oriented (tho i would like to be)\r\n*do not like threesomes\r\n*don\u2019t have the \u2018girl magic\u2019 thing that some girls have where they emanate a soft glow of feminine nurturing care\r\n*I\u2019m not nurturing in general. I\u2019m absentminded and am bad at tracking needs when those needs deviate significantly from my own. I still don\u2019t remember my partners birthdays.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso generic stats: born 1992, height 5\u20198, live in east bay",

I\u2019m Lulie, you can find out more about me below, or much more on my\nabout\npage.\nFill out this form\nif you\u2019re interested! I love people and I\u2019d love to hear from you even if you don\u2019t fit everything listed below \u2013 please don\u2019t be shy. \ud83d\ude0a\nAge: 35\nLocation: Oxford, UK\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\nMonogamous\nNever been married, want to\nDon\u2019t have kids, want 1-2\nPhilosophy Twitter:\n@reasonisfun\n~\u00a0 Social Twitter:\n@metaLulie\nMe\nEnthusiastic, driven to understand the fundamentals/first principles behind stuff, outgoing introvert, playful (but still British), introspective and self-aware, caring.\n\ud83c\udfa5\nHere\u2019s a\nvideo\nshowing my playful side, and\nhere\u2019s one\n(old) that\u2019s more intellectual.\nWorld views:\nI\u2019m a very open-minded classical liberal / Old Whig. I think people should have freedom, but I believe in morality (i.e. that some things are a bad idea). I value tradition as a good starting point, but I believe strongly in the advance of human progress.\nThings I\u2019m good at:\nJoyful, driven optimism. Explaining complicated/technical things in simple/understandable ways. Writing. Recognising the difference between substance and form, and the difference between meta and on-topic. Maintaining a childlike spirit. Irrepressible curiosity. Seeing things from another\u2019s point of view. Connecting people, creating/running communities. Using search engines to find the answers to stuff I don\u2019t know. Ten-finger typing (~100 WPM). Listening to audio at x3 speed. Learning how to learn. Art theory.\nInfluences:\nKarl Popper, David Deutsch, Richard Feynman, William Godwin, Thomas Szasz, Ayn Rand, Lewis Carroll, David Chapman.\nIf you\u2019re into Popper/Deutsch, stop reading here and\njust message me already\n. \ud83e\udd70\nLately, I\u2019ve enjoyed the work of\nJoe Hudson\n(emotions, connection),\nTiago Forte\n(productivity),\nDavid Perell\n(taking ideas seriously),\nMichael Ashcroft\nand\nPeter Nobes\n(Alexander Technique), and\nFrank Anderson\n(Internal Family Systems).\nRelationship style\nI\u2019m looking to date towards a somewhat traditional, long-term relationship, ultimately leading to marriage & children. I\u2019m a devoted partner, and I like pursuing my own interests and projects (if that\u2019s with my partner that\u2019s even better, but I\u2019m happy having alone time too).\nI want a masculine partner to complement my feminine wiles, but I\u2019d like us able to explore any way of relating! Relationships can have\nmore\nvibrancy and creativity when monogamous (and certainly more depth) than what\u2019s possible otherwise. I dig this line from Peterson,\n\u201cI\u2019ve slept with hundreds of women, and they were all my wife\u201d\n: an individual is so varied that you can have an infinite number of experiences with one person.\nI\u2019m a big romantic. \u2764\ufe0f\u00a0 (And recovering edgelord.)\nYou\nMy ideal partner is someone\ndeeply curious\nabout the world so we can explore it together,\nopen-minded\nso we can talk about anything,\nsocially skilled\nso we can go anywhere and interact with anyone,\nintellectually sharp\nso we can challenge each other,\nempathetic\nso the relationship is deeply caring and understanding without needing words for everything, and\nshares values\nwith me so we can be a well-functioning team. A bit of Feynmanian mischievousness doesn\u2019t hurt either. \ud83d\ude01\nLooking for someone in his 30s (or 29-43).\nI\u2019d like to connect over shared interests! Ideally one or more of my main interests:\n\u272c\nPhilosophy\nEpistemology, morality, consciousness, political & aesthetic philosophy\n\u272c\nArt\nClassical painting, concept art, manga, comics, caricature, editorial cartoons\n\u272c\nPsychology\nHow the mind works, therapy, mental health, personal development & productivity\nI have no height preferences, but if you work out that\u2019s a big plus.\nFamily\nI was home-educated and raised under\nTaking Children Seriously\n\u2013 a philosophy that aims to respect and help children by their own lights.\nMy life plan is to work on that philosophy, make it practical and accessible, and develop the movement. Figuring out how to create happy families and not break the spirits of children (and still have them function in the world) is, IMO, one of the most important things we can do upstream to facilitate human flourishing.\nI\u2019d like to find a partner willing to raise children with compassion, care and a profound respect for their autonomy.\n\ud83d\udc9b\nPhotos\nCopyright 2025 \u00a9 Lulie Tanett",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHi potentially future boyfriend!\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Nicole! If you have somehow stumbled upon this google doc through the interwebs, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here. I\u2019m gonna go full listicle on you for this but I promise I can hold non-bulleted conversations \ud83d\ude05\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy ~vibe~\r\n* I smile and laugh a lot! I love doing silly things and going down rabbit hole conversations with strangers or friends \r\n   * Ex: I go to adult summer camps and my dream life would basically be having summer camp all year \ud83d\ude05\r\n* I\u2019m crafty! I can sew, knit, draw, paint, doodle, you name it. My love language is being able to sew buttons back on your shirt for you \ud83d\ude18 \r\n   * Ex: I\u2019m a full time artist and I make watercolor art about climate change. \r\n* In the words of the wise Nick Miller, \u201cI just want to live a weird and wonderful life together.\u201d \r\n   * Ex: I once hosted a peanut butter tasting to determine what brand is the best. Email me to find out \ud83d\ude09 \r\n\r\n\r\nSome things I value \r\n* Curiosity and creativity- I want a partner who follows their curiosity and likes to make things. That could be art, programming, music, whatever \u201cmaking\u201d means to you.\r\n* Silliness- I want someone to laugh with. \r\n* Nerdiness- Whatever you love, I love to hear about. I love a right brain/left brain combo.\r\n* Empathy and kindness- Looking for someone who is kind to the people in their life and feels warm and fuzzy to be around. \r\n* Community minded- I love gathering friends and being a part of intentional communities. Looking for someone who wants to create shared experiences with people we love. \r\n* Exploring- I\u2019ve traveled a lot in the past and love the mindset of adventure. Right now I\u2019m more interested in domestic travel and finding ways to explore my own city. I love weird art events, comedy shows, and getting out of the city on weekends.\r\n* Grounding energy- I\u2019m very creative and can float off into my own ideas. Having a grounding presence in a partner would be a nice balance. \r\n* Healthy- I love cooking, meditating, and swimming. Physical and mental health is really important to me! \r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of my work life, I\u2019ve always cared a lot about what I do and want to work in fields that I think are making a positive impact in the world:\r\n* I started my first business when I was in my college dorm room. It was a handbag brand and I taught myself how to sew. I got hooked on entrepreneurship when I was 18.\r\n* I worked for a digital nomad company called Hacker Paradise my last semester of college and traveled through Southeast Asia and Europe\r\n* After graduation, I moved to NY and co-founded a kids coding program. We sold that in 2019.  \r\n* I pivoted to working in climate tech. For fun, I decided to paint a watercolor a day for 100 days and it went viral. I quit my job after 4 months of painting and now make art about climate change full time! \r\n* I make custom watercolor infographics for climate organizations like the Department of Energy, Harvard, Sunrun, and Project Drawdown. I published a coloring book about clean energy. I love what I do so much! \r\n\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re also probably wondering about the facts you normally get on a dating app:\r\n   * I\u2019m 31 and 5\u20196\u201d and looking for a monogamous relationship with a man. \r\n   * I don\u2019t know if I want kids. I may be open to adopting, fostering, or having my own if it feels right down the road with the right person.\r\n   * I\u2019m vegetarian and don\u2019t drink or do drugs.\r\n   * I\u2019m Jewish but don\u2019t actively practice.\r\n   * I live in NYC but don\u2019t plan to forever. I\u2019d love to live by a beach or lake in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen flags\r\n   * You make a clear plan with time/location and check in the same day to confirm\r\n   * You love what you do for work or have a hobby you love \r\n\r\n\r\nSay hi!\r\nIf you want to say hi, just shoot me an email at nicolek13@gmail.com. Tell me a bit about yourself and send over a photo! I have a preference to meet folks who live in NYC but I\u2019m open to other cities.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffOriginal posted on a personals subreddit in January 2022.\r\nContact: date.mark.1co4i@simplelogin.com \r\n\u2014\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it is courtesy here to apologize for lengthy posts. I can tell you that there's no tl;dr; I hope that scrolling down something would catch your eye, and if I'm lucky, having read a paragraph enticed you to read more. I have very roughly tried to progress from the general to the particular; we know that the devil is in the details but it is the context that imbues it with significance. Words can only do so much to give a sense of a person, and I can hardly imagine a more anonymous place than a personals subreddit. If I may quote from a writer reflecting on his time as a drafted Vietnam war soldier,\r\n\r\n\r\n> I confess that a large number of Americans I met in the Army amazed me by their differentness. I had not known their like before, nor have I met them since. Nothing else could have made me realize how narrow the circle in which we move in peacetime is. Most of us hardly get an inkling of how ninety per cent of our fellows live or think. Naively we assume that they must be like us or not very different.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd what is true about the American draft might be yet truer to the vast internet? Or is the variance narrower in Berlin?\r\n\r\n\r\nMy intention here is to give you as much sense of my person without you yet having met me. To read this fully will take you longer than reading other here ads, but less than riding the bike or U-Bahn to meet me, a ride that can be spared if you find something off in here lines from the comfort of your home or phone. If both of us are lucky, perhaps, on the contrary, it would give rise to that ride at the end of which two people, who did not know they missed each other, find each other and share a pleasant evening. And if we are very lucky, perhaps share many days thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a Russia-born, Israel-raised, 33 y/o (since two days!) who came to Berlin in 2014 for a master's and stayed here for work. A bit of an over-thinker, I love musing about and discussing the little and big things: how expectations shape our perception, how perception shapes our understanding of ourselves and the world; how attitudes are formed and how a given culture arises. The human mind, animal behaviour, culture, language, our political and economic system & its history have fascinated me since many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor my bachelor's I studied math and physics. The reason I chose that major was admittedly rather hoity-toity: I can't say it was the subject I was most interested in, but it was among the subject I was interested in and the one that, I thought, would be the most difficult to learn without others to guide me, i.e., teachers. The institution was a so called \"liberal arts college\" in the US and I took ample advantage of the opportunity to take courses outside my major, as well as going so far as borrowing text-books in the library to read over the summer; textbooks about social and evolutionary psychology and behavioural biology.\r\n\r\n\r\nI started my master's for the \"wrong reasons\". By the last year of my bachelor's I was set to be done with academics and \"start real life\" (as if the term bore significance); I had wanted to leave Israel and to move to Europe. Seeing that it was too complicated to do so otherwise I chose what appeared to be the easiest route in: to start studying there. Since high-school I had had a particular attraction towards Germany, I think because of my Volga-German paternal grandfather who died before I was born, and because my favourite aunt lives in the city, but not wanting to narrow my choices I cast my net broadly, and so I could say I was lucky to find an intriguing program ausgerechnet in Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unexpected googling result, the program was in \"computational neuroscience,\" a term I did not know and which I had still not understood after reading its Wikipedia entry, but which, I thought, matched my case: the \"computational\" part matched my educational background and the \"neuroscience\" part matched my interest in the relationship between mind & body and the biological underpinning of human behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe program was difficult for me, for reasons that were personal (having looked too much outside my major during my bachelor's, making me somewhat less prepared than others; being used to a different student-professor relationship) and circumstantially unfortunate (not having been prepared for how difficult and time consuming finding a WG in my budget was, which itself brought further hardships), but I finished in good time. This \"good time\" was a long while, longer than programmed, but on par with my peers. As a classmate and friend had said, that it was a 2-years program was a lie.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy studies were followed by a long and therefore difficult period of job searching, looking for a position as a data-scientist, elongated by my difficulties with German (which since then I speak much better, also in my job), uncertainties about fine points of my then legal status in the country, and mostly by having little connections in Berlin and by being a bad judge of my own skills and abilities, always leaning diffidence-wards. Nonetheless I felt lucky at the end when \u2013\u2013being ready to sell myself to any evil corporation to optimize its commercials or recommendations\u2013\u2013 I got a job at a \"medical-tech\" company which employs machine learning to improve diagnostics of health complications during pregnancies. While I was hired as a data scientist, in the last few months, our team being understaffed, I did nothing but implement changes to our app. At least in our company xmas dinner the head of tech voiced that I was over qualified for the work that I was doing and the boss encouraged him to get me out of that and put me on the data as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommitment to writing\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this day whenever I see a great piece of art, whatever the form \u2013\u2013literature, film, paintings, music, video games, furniture\u2013\u2013, I'm attracted by the idea of creating something similar, rarely going beyond the act of sketching blue-prints for future projects. What has stuck, however, is the decision I made when I was about 15, that I shall be a writer. For a very long time I had not been much of a writer and was reluctant using that title. I wrote mostly short story beginnings and fragments; I was surprised to find years later that these were not so bad, but all the same they didn't amount to much. When I first came to the US I remember telling others that I would never be able to speak English from the heart, but by a year or so later it had changed, and English is still my language of choice. A creative writing professor on my final year was very supportive; I used to think that she was merely nice, that is, to everyone, but later I heard different experiences from other students. All the same, perhaps I received special treatment as the odd non-literature student. All the same, it was encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy passion is in writing fiction, but I discovered the power of my writing to captivate people (as I hereby try to captivate you) on mundane occasions: emails to a different literature professor, about how I had found it difficult to keep up with the reading, who praised them during class(!) (they were written in an 18th century English, appropriately to the course); an excuse email to a tutor in my master's, for having failed to submit my homework, who wrote me back that I had made her day; personal and philosophizing \u2013\u2013and often admittedly too long\u2013\u2013 emails to friends, one of which had asked to forward an email to two friends of hers because she thought \"it would help them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the while I was also writing the occasional not very good short story, sending it to one journal I had set my mind on, which has never accepted my submissions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a minor breakthrough a few years ago, when I answered an ad recruiting team members to work on a so called indie video game. \"Writers\" were not sought but I found the ad intriguing and contacted the guy anyway, expressing my interest. We had some back and forth, he presented me his idea on a call and I wrote him back my opinion of the project. I expected our connection to end then and there: I was very critical of many aspects of his work, and us being strangers, I thought he would want to not have anything to do with me anymore. I was critical not because I wanted to bring him down or insult him, but precisely because I liked the guy and his attitude and so cared enough to take the time, risk the \"being not nice\" in order to share my point of view. He wrote me back to say that he found my comments helpful, and from then on we collaborated. When I told him that I no longer had time for his project (this was during my job-searching period; my time went to answering postings and on making myself qualified for the positions I was seeking), he offered to pay me to write for his game  \u2013\u2013 an offer I accepted. So I may say that I have been paid for my writing, I almost forgot about it. The breakthrough came from the fact that his approach to story-telling/ sharing ideas, let's say, was very akin to mine, and seeing it from the outside I became aware of its shortcomings, storytelling-wise.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust over a year ago I had the last of piecemeal revelations which brought about a major leap. After involving a good friend of mine in my endeavour, I began to write regularly, daily, with clear aims before me. My new expedient attitude had set me to write short stories but my expansive nature (a hint of which you might be picking up) proved to me that I am more of a (potential) novelist. I'm currently working on a novel and I am glad to announce that it has been progressing very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI & honesty\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a great part of my life I held honesty (being true) and openness (being transparent) to be prime virtues. These served me well:\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen I was drafted to the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force, I was put into artillery, a combat unit. While I enjoyed the training (truly a \"guilty pleasure\"), when it came to being part of maintaining the occupation, I couldn't do it. I asked my direct commander for a conversation and laid it out to him: I didn't believe in this and that, refused to continue cooperating, and explicitly expressed my willingness to go to military prison if my words amounted to insubordination. I was surprised to find that the commander \u2013\u2013whose very different political leaning/ worldview was known (I was amused when he told me that his girlfriend was \"just like that, too\")\u2013\u2013 responded very graciously. The rest of the story is rather involved to lay down here completely, but the bottom line was that honesty received its points. I approached my problem with words and it was rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen there was the matter already written here, about coming to my teachers and making explicit my shortcomings as a student, which were always met with support. I also wouldn't forget how in high-school a good friend of mine came to the math teacher with his graded exam and showed her how one of his solutions, despite a mistake he had made, was marked as correct. She answered that he was right that he was wrong, but let him keep the grade. Together with other friends I remonstrated, though only in jest, we respected his action.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally with my friends I always found that opening up yielded positive results. I wouldn't forget how towards the end of my second year of college my roommate wrote me a long Facebook message where he expressed a resentment he had towards me, to which thitherto I was unaware, mentioning that \"[I] remembered how you told me once that it's better to talk about issues rather then holding on to it, so I thought it would be good for us to talk about it.\" He vented his grudges, I apologized, we discussed it and sorted it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I have also experienced the limits of honesty. My t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates with commanders buoyed up the ranks up to the battalion commander who did not, like the others, simply hear me out, but \"argued\" with me. After that conversation I deliberated with myself about whether in some circumstances \"lying was ok.\" Recognizing the shortness of the power of my words, I resorted to action \u2013\u2013 which despite the military settings and my internal sense of drama, did not involve helicopters, shooting or explosions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in college I told my Nabokov course professor that I couldn't, that is, wouldn't, write the final paper for the course because I had a greater calling (my then novel in writing) and she gave me the grade that I deserved, adjusted by sympathies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my long job-searching period my honest but implicit importing of my lack of ability to assess the comparison between my relevant skillfulness with that of the imagined potential competition's might have been taken as an expression of a lack of aptness in the skills themselves, or so one could imagine. And so I did imagine, along with hundreds other stories of why it was that I wasn't getting a job (none of which, though you probably didn't think so, had to do with immigrants).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the army I was trying to \"follow the rules\", to follow my agreeable nature <3, while not following them. I now wonder that there was an effect that was as paradoxical as that in the liar's paradox. I observed once a soldier being immediately punished upon his refusal to pick up a shell during drilling (I now wonder if I had been anything to inspire; it was after my disobedient \"coming out\" and I was passing by him), a response very different to the one I had received. My refusal bore the structure of \"I thereby break the rule,\" and had the effect of excusing myself from all that I did not want to do while being dealt with as if I was operating within the rules. For a long period I was let to merely \"hang around\", only being assigned only cleaning and watch duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my Nabokov course professor I was being honest when I told her that I wanted to dedicate the time to my fiction project, but I was in fact also proving myself a point, namely, that I was free from the expectations of institutions, or, more exactly, that I came to school to learn and not to be accredited, and since I was not going to continue on the academic path (which turned to be false) my final grades were not important and putting the effort to prove a professor that I deserved her good opinion and thereby sacrificing my art(!!) was plain silly. And perhaps I wanted her to think of me as a bud of something as great as Nabokov. And also I was trying to repeat a trick that did work for me in Freshman year (A; but there was more heart in it) than in that senior year (C; if I recall correctly).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's the point of the above? It is not the case that honesty per se has rendered me a disservice, but rather that being honest is not always very trivial. For one thing, words do not merely carry the information they directly encode, but establish a certain relationship between the speaker and recipient. As you are reading it, presumably, you are not building a picture of myself based just on the content of my words, but also on my choice of things to include, their order, what I exclude. You might wonder, to put it simply, why I am telling you certain things.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this is the reason why I enjoy having \"theoretical discussions\" with people with Asperger's or who are close to \"that end of the spectrum\"; from my experience they don't take their opinions so personally so when I disagree with them they don't take it to mean that \"I dislike them\" or that \"we do not get along\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon which seems to me to best capture the dynamic between words and the relationship they engender between the people using them is that of flirting. And I think what is true with flirting, in a long but circumscribed moment between two persons, is true for all interpersonal communications and their Wittgensteinian language games.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do the flirters do? There's a play that is not merely about reflecting reality as one sees it but about negotiating, implicitly, the creation of a new reality: the potential transformation of a \"one and a one\" into \"a two\" into a different kind of \"one\"; the flirters bring in their expectations of the nature of this new unit, they bring in their expectations of the expectations of the other person, they discuss the unit, they gauge the other's willingness and adequateness and entice the other into the unit by proving that they are fit for their own part. There's always the question: is the other merely a nice person, that is, nice to everybody, or specifically nice to me? Is this person habitually touchy or are they hitting on me? Does the other person tell me about their recent break up because they have an urge to share the fresh experience? Because they want advice? Because they want to communicate to me their availability?\r\n\r\n\r\nA memory of non-flirting comes to my mind. I was at a Berlin lake's beach. A small group of cheerful gals was sitting on the next spot. A guy, who evidently had had some interaction with them earlier, approached and spoke to one of them. He said that he was new in the city, that he didn't know much people, and asked if she would be his friend, wanted to exchange numbers. I had a perfect view of this interaction, and I suspected that the naive and simple approach was a poorly disguised trick, that he was trying to pick her up, and the gal, who was not born yesterday, must have suspected likewise. As you might imagine, the gal declined his kind offer and after a bit of insistence the guy left. What works in kindergarten (and in A Beautiful Mind) often doesn't work in the adult world.\r\n\r\n\r\nI admit that, unfortunately, I'm not good at flirting, but I recognize that while words can try to describe that which happens between one person and another, they cannot define it, cannot conjure it out of nothingness by themselves. It seems to me that people don't even always know what they themselves want, and if they do, they don't know what they might desire in the future, after they discover something or their circumstances change. Words are a combination of bearing witness to the present, reporting on the past and making a prediction, or a promise, onto the future, and therein their ambiguity.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do we remain honest, report things about ourselves as they are, when we are aware that we are constantly changing? When we know that we continue to disappoint our own selves? When we know, perhaps, that our self disappointment is a sign that we had set ourselves high-bars that we worked hard to strive towards, without which we would have remained lying on the bottom? How do we promise \"eternal love\" when we have no regard for any church's allotted sanctity and we witness divorces as a normal occurrence around us, and know that we, too, are only human?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you understand, this is not a call for dishonesty, lack of commitment or the abandoning of communication of needs and expectations. It is not the case that I think that words are meaningless or that \"there's no truth\" (I'm already answering protractors, but I trust that you understand me). No. This is a petition to act out a relationship between us\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere language is used to improve each other's and our surrounding's lives and conditions \u2013\u2013 I don't mean that we will fix the world with words, but that we won't violently force words upon it, or argue about words as if they were the matter themselves;\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere we employ language as a tool to understand each other and not to bind each other, committed to the idea that each one of us has one's needs, desires, energies and fancies that need to be humoured and supported in our effort of maintaining our togetherness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it has not been yet stated quite so unequivocally: I am looking for a single woman to form a dyad with, to give meaning to each other with, to figure out the world with, and when the world is ready for it, raise some children with. There. This last part goes somewhat against what I mentioned when on the topic of flirting, but as there are people who are certain they do not want to have children it made sense to mention it. But that would anyhow be in the far future, and we do not need to discuss it yet. We take it all in baby-steps. We are considerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI & Shyness\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been the big drama of my adolescence. When I was 12 I realized that I was shy. It's seems funny to me that such things have to be learned, but there's no escape from the fact that when we are born we do not \"know ourselves,\" in the most trivial sense, and need time to be discovered to our own selves. Need \"time\" meaning the occasion for the discovery; in my case it was watching the series Neon Genesis Evangelion with its timid protagonist Shinji. It incited an interest in psychology, which the then young internet (pre-google!) led me to believe equaled Freud's Id and Ego and the rest of it. I diagnosed myself with \"social phobia\", a recognition with which I turned with glee, as if I had solved a great mystery, to others: to classmates on MSN messenger, with whom I hadn't otherwise spoken in school, who listened; to my friends, one of which mocked my diagnosis and denied it. Be as it may, I found out soon enough, on a classmate's Bar Mitzvah party, that being aware of a problem is not quite 80% of having solved it, and that while Shinji supposedly overcame his issues on the last episode I had watched that same day, he did it alone \u2013\u2013\u2013 without me.\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked my parents to take me to the therapist, which they did. I remember drawing a boy, describing it, and being shy about drawing a girl. This sounds caricaturistic, but I remember being given the Rorschach test, and describing a scene of two alien kingdoms sealing an accord of peace with the touch of their leaders' long index-fingers \u2013\u2013\u2013 a scene that upon searching it years later, though having found the implicated Card X, I couldn't again see. At a trough I was suggested antidepressants and I must have hinted willingness because next the psychiatrist and my parents appeared; I also remember that the offer was left to me to decide (by the staff? by my parents? unaware of it when young, I was almost amazed when I reflected on it as an adult at the degree of trust my parents had always put in me) and that I declined it. I don't remember how long I attended sessions; it was at least a few months and less than a year. I had gotten some insights out of it but eventually decided that I felt like it was not helping me much, and I was out. This, by the way, was the last time that I sought \"professional help\" for \"mental health\" related issues, though not the last time that I suffered of anything of that sort. That being said, while still occasionally having been afflicted with depression afterwards, I am happy to say that since my early twenties I have learned to cope with the little devils in my head and since two years they are positively gone (without, as Rilke has put it, the angels having fled with them).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout my adolescence I invested a lot of thought into my problem of shyness, and what brought the eventual succour was a simple change of circumstances. For 9 years I had attended the same school, the same class of 40 kids, and the simple transition to a different school, when high-school came around, and its requirement to make new acquaintances, was of great help. I did not make it very easy for it to do so, however: in my high-school the classes were reshuffled every year, with the exception of two: one which was \"special\" in the euphemistic sense (but not too special; I think it was called the \"sports class\") and the other was the gifted class. I tell you right away that I had not undergone any tests to get into the latter. When I came to register for high-school \u2013\u2013I remember being alone with the secretary in her office\u2013\u2013 I said that I wanted to be in gifted class. That was enough to get admission. It's one thing with young rosy cheeked children, I suppose a teenager's willingness alone, in that angsty age, is enough of a criterion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf in high-school I put myself in one \"extreme\" of being again in the same class and its group of students all-throughout, the army (which is a whole story on its own) was on the other: already mid-training I had been moved from one unit to another, a pattern that continued until my discharge with a rough average of one month per unit, having to make new acquaintances on each transition. It was during this time, incidentally, that the seeds of my affection towards FKK had been sown; it made as much sense to go to the showers together as it did to go to dinner together. Why shower alone when you can shower and have a conversation at the same time? This idea comes to me now for the first time in my life: let's have two showers. Make it big, give it two showerheads, so we could shower together. Tongue in the cheek but serious nonetheless!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe army was the beginning of the end of my problem. I know that in college I still considered myself an introvert because a TED talk about introverts inspired me to follow the advice of \"taking advantage of what introverts were good at\" (I'm paraphrasing) and \"express myself in writing rather than face to face\" to tackle an uncertainty that I had in the wooing of my then crush. I copied (unnecessarily, though it felt more personal that way) in handwriting a long letter that I composed for her. That I ended up awake until four in the morning was because of the calligraphy I rendered on the front page, which I thought was not so bad for a first attempt. This, as you might imagine, did not work so well, and was hinged partially on the misguided sense that a romantic relationship could be agreed on when in fact it should be developed. And on my impatience, perhaps. If it was the first then I admit it was not the last of grand gestures made thus by me for such purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen sonnets that I wrote to a stranger who had twitted \"Pablo Neruda wrote a hundred sonnets to his wife while I can't get a guy to go to acro yoga with me idgi\" won me a phone number + a reserved willingness to meet for coffee, but either my apologetic reply email or my stumblings on our short WhatsApp correspondence made her turn the other cheek.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen was a long half love letter half Ode to Berlin written to an Ok-Cupid connection. We had corresponded extensively on the days preceding her visit to Berlin, had a skype and hung out a couple of times while she was here. I sent her the email while she was travelling in Hungary after Berlin. Well: she didn't want to have anything with me afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have learned my lesson, alluded to on the previous section about words and honesty, and that Ode to Berlin was the last time I attempted anything of this sort. I am not unaware that this here post is of the same genre, me jumping around, feeling like a bird of paradise trying to captivate your attention and pique your interest. However, this time I do not pretend that I know who you are, nor what sort of relationship we might develop together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy have I written so much? Am I desperate? Crazy? Obsessed?\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not desperate, but concerned. Indeed, my self sufficiently leads me to believe that if I do not do anything about it, I could easily go through life by myself. A good friend joked that I was preparing for the covid situation all of my life. Indeed, I am not unhappy alone but I am often sad that I do not share my life with more people. And my wish to make a family one day is dear to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrazy? Maybe a little but not in disconcerting ways. I have, anyhow, encouraged others' notion of myself as being a little fou fou; people start to expect the unexpected, in little ways, which means that they do not quite judge me by their usual standards, which is liberating. Or this is how I have explained it to myself; perhaps they do judge me all the same within themselves but they have not complained and I am happy to beat my own drum.\r\n\r\n\r\nObsessive? Maybe. It took me a good decade and a half to cultivate a passion for writing, and it is there that my obsession perhaps lies; it is no less powerful for being self-made. As it may be, I enjoy writing, telling stories, sharing my ideas and, most of all: having conversations, for which writing could hopefully at least (but also: only so much) set a table. As Yoel Hoffmann wrote in \"Curriculum Vitae\":\r\n\r\n\r\n> If I could [in a sort of pact that was deeper than that between an author and a reader] fall on the necks of people and tell them: come and let us sit and steep tea and drink and you will tell me your life and I will tell you my life, I would have tossed the manuscript in the paper bin and done it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I see it, I'm just trying to present myself and attract the like minded. I'm not trying to dance the tango alone. This post is not the final word but the excuse, the occasion, to discuss things. Any written word, anyhow, can remain valid only so long. This is just the beginning, as Melannie C sings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of college I was no longer sure how valid my former placement of myself on the introvert-extrovert scale was, important only as a function of my interest in the so called Big Five Model. I have been enthusiastic and talkative in companies I cared about since childhood, only it took a couple of decades for me to find myself comfortable with people I had just met. Consulting Wikipedia, I'd say I suppose I am indeed an introvert, only the social aspects don't quite apply.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps because of the long way it had taken me, this is something I am proud of to the point of bragging about it:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I first came to college I held the childish bratty opinion that people who danced were shallow and stupid. A year and a half later I sought to \"learn to dance\": I asked a roommate and a friend about it; the one told me that he didn't actually know how to dance (I thought otherwise) and that he had always felt ashamed whenever he went to clubs where were good dancers; the other told me to make love to the music. With this information and with the simple yet very useful Wikihow instructions on the topic(!) (ask me about it; I bet it has changed since then. Now it probably includes the steps \"stay hydrated\" and \"eat fresh fruit\") I gradually came to the present point where dancing is one of my favourite things to do. Unfortunately these plague days have not offered much opportunity to dance with other people, though I do it from time to time alone in my room. And the braggy part: already then a friend told me that I was the best dancer in our college, which I thought was a mighty exaggeration but I took it anyway. Since then almost every time that I dance in public, at night (I guess people have to be at least a little tozy-mozy), a stranger(!) would approach me to compliment my dancing. Once a person came to me and handed me a flower \"for the best dancer on the dancefloor.\" Among my circles enthusiastic dancers are not so common, so I welcome getting know people with this passion :) But as I said, most of the people I like are not keen dancers, so that's fine, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first dialogues that I ever came up with, even though I didn't write them down, were a direct consequence of my shyness. On the afternoon that serves as the best example, I was working myself up to call to book tickets for games on a then forthcoming RPG conference. I couldn't, in my anxiety, just pick up the phone and call. Instead, I imagined the interaction, playing through the various possible sequences of the imminent exchange, depending on whether there were still seats on this or that game, all the while pacing my room back and forth. Possibly it had taken an hour until I did manage to make the call.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference was not very easy, nonetheless; I find amusing the notion of being shy/awkward within a gathering for playing pen and paper RPG, stereotypically perhaps the geekiest of activities. Having been an outlier age-wise in the conference (still in middle-school, not sure what year this was), did nothing to improve. Towards the end of one of the games attention was turned to me; this was an act of kindness by one Idit \u2013\u2013I knew her as a personality on the Israeli RPG forum\u2013\u2013 who wanted to include the thitherto quiet player. I became flustered and I felt my cheeks growing warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of my shyness that has to do with my writing, as well as with the attitude I have developed towards \"honesty\", was a fear \u2013\u2013if that's the right word\u2013\u2013 of lying. Equipped with an inaccurate theory of mind, it seemed to me that any potential lie was obvious in its deviation from the truth. It occurred to me recently that fiction writers are really professional lie-yarners. My shying away from \"being caught lying\" had made fiction writing difficult to me, but at the same time, I believe, it leads me to write better. I carefully scrutinize all I write and it helps making the text hold better together.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFiction writers make a certain implicit ceremony, like shamans summoning spirits to possess them, before they begin their narration (and when they don't, as was the case with \"A Million Little Pieces\", things do not remain quiet), and we do not take their words at face value. Nonetheless, it's precisely the extent to which their stories ring true that we enjoy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI & Sex\r\n\r\n\r\nIf hunger can be the excuse or opportunity to create something beautifully tasty, so can be the urges of the loins. While I esteem some of Buddhism's ideas regarding wanting & suffering, I think life is to be enjoyed. Perhaps am an epicurean, in the sense of valuing the cultivated pleasure, but maybe that's just hot air. I think life should be enjoyed \u2013\u2013 the generality of this sort of sentence's amounts to be meaningless without some context, but I don't know that I could articulate it. Godard films spring to my mind, perhaps due to my idea of the French idea of joi de vivre, though I can't say I recall Belmondo ever playing anybody who particularly enjoyed life.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't want to give you the wrong impression that my life is full of indulgent sensuality and excitement. I love hiking but I do not do it often, and if you find me in the jungle with a knife in my teeth, it is likely to be in imagination and not in body. I would have loved to be surrounded by harpists and marble, eating oysters inside a warm milk bath, but I choose my battles: on can have some but not all pleasures the world has to offer, and I'm mostly aiming at a different category. A year or two ago I did fix myself a hot bath and read in it. The effort, aggravated by the fact that the boiler's volume was smaller than the bathtub's, that the water cooled down rather quickly, that there was scarcely a dry place to put the book down on, made it not worth it. And still I repeated this once or even twice.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think our fancies should be obliged!\r\n\r\n\r\nI think what I value most is the pursuit of art and science, which I find to be close kin of each other rather than the polar opposites they often portrayed as. Let us invest our resources into meeting our needs, into sustaining ourselves, and the rest into creating the true and beautiful, whether taken by our senses or by our thoughts \u2013\u2013 or, as often is the case, by their combination. Sounds lofty, I suppose, but a good direction to go in. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy French friends might look askance at me saying it, but I take some care to eat tastily. And when I make food for others I try to make it beautiful. I would not forget how my father (who has never cooked) heated up in the microwave for my return from school a simple dish of rice and toppings that my mom had made, and presented it as \"The seven samurai climbing up a snowy mountain\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hold the above all the more so with regards to sex since in it, in a sense, we consume each other, and therefore take the relish personally. One could either gobble up potatoes to kill one's stomach rumbles, or take the most out of a meal by using it to express care, explore the senses, keep oneself healthy and in love with life. I call for sex to be used to relieve each other's stresses, to let us understand each other's and our own bodies better, learn our pains and pleasures. I would not have said it if I didn't get the idea that some view it differently, but in sex I had relished nothing more than the expressions of pleasure of my partner. My own little death, if you allow me, is almost a disappointment, like the end of a good movie that is bound to come but oh how we wish there was more.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, sex could be used to negotiate and to come in terms with each other: sex is but a special case, the case where it is most obvious that our requirements are asymmetrical. What is fair? 1:1 can be fair but so could 3:1. This depends on how we measure fairness, which could hark back to the old but ever present economical question of \"what is value\". Does it depend on the intensity of the need, of the satisfaction, of the effort to bring it? I say: let us be generous, to ourselves and each other, in sex and otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosting this ad\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like it's not the place, but nonetheless I want to start with a technological lament. Perhaps you are familiar with it, perhaps not: OK-Cupid, a little more than five years ago, was a great tool. I met through it my last girlfriend, I've met one of my still best friends, and had numerous other nice interactions. I found its q&a based \"match\" calculations to be neat and helpful. Since then it has been sold and transformed into an awful Tinder-like slot machine. This has nothing to do with the present ad, but: I certainly think that the world needs to have such a platform recreated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth though I still have an account there and if you do too, we could look at the percentage. Perhaps we are the kind that trust that math.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was looking for a job my finances were so stringent that it made me often eschew even going out with friends, to say nothing of dating. I had a real sense of lying outside society by the void in my pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that it is not a consideration, society is amidst a plague. My employment straddles its very beginning: I was offered my job before \"Corona\" meant anybody anything but a beer, and signed the contract with a mask and disinfected hands. Between these two points was a dramatic suspense. The confirmation of the project's budget by the Charit\u00e9 was delaying and I worried that money would be redirected to virus-related research, of which our project was not one, leaving my own travails ongoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince a couple of months I've joined a few meetup book-clubs and already made a friend, and then came the great new surge of covid cases that pushed people back to online meetings. Well, you know the situation, I don't need to tell you about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fancifully hopeful intention is to be able to make a connection, like magic, through these here words. I say \"like magic\" not just because the effect would be brought up by a spell, but because the effect itself is akin to the sudden appearance of something out of nothing, like a pigeon inside a hat. I'm thinking here of Hannah Arendt and her writing (which I hold very dear), and how she formulated the coming into the world of people as the emergence of the New. She was referring to birth, but it applies to new connections just the same \u2013\u2013 a person emerging into the world of another. With all respect to \"Recommended to you\" algorithms, is there any occurrence more transformative and opening than the meeting and the engagement with a like minded stranger? Yes, my hopes are lofty but all the same worthy of the effort. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is explicitly an ad to find a partner, but I would be happy to make new friends of any gender as well, so if you are not looking, taken or already interested in me only otherwise, I encourage you to write me too. It's all very far from it, but I have had fantasies of living in a Seinfeld-world where friendly faces barged through the door unbidden. College was a little like this, and though at each moment I did not welcome unwelcome barging-ins, I knew that it made life better. I'm in Berlin, as the title has it, and though I recognize that our contact would begin and incubate online, my hope is that sooner than later we would sit around a shared table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't expect things to happen quickly. As mentioned before, this is just the beginning. Love, as I see it, is not about \"finding the right one,\" but about finding someone with whom to earn each other's trust to cultivate together a shared life. I'm thinking here of Alain de Botton's idea of \"Lovers needing to be each other's teachers\". One doesn't find love but grows it. A paragraph from Williams' Stoner comes to mind, too:\r\n\r\n\r\n> In his extreme youth Stoner had thought of love as an absolute state of being to which, if one were lucky, one might find access; in his maturity he had decided it was the heaven of a false religion, toward which one ought to gaze with an amused disbelief, a gently familiar contempt, and an embarrassed nostalgia. Now in his middle age he began to know that it was neither a state of grace nor an illusion; he saw it as a human act of becoming, a condition that was invented and modified moment by moment and day by day, by the will and the intelligence and the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is stepping somewhat ahead, but in case it might be on your mind: I don't feel strongly rooted in Berlin. I have ogled the north and I can imagine an eventuality of myself moving to settle elsewhere, but at the same time I don't currently have a reason to do so. Learning German did make me break sweat, but no matter. Loving languages I'd be glad for a good reason to learn a new one. I'll learn yours!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn appendix of books and movies\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest \u2013\u2013from here down\u2013\u2013 is much less important, and is provided for the sake of further self-description (to the extent such things testify) and maybe an opportunity for discussion \u2013\u2013 some things I recently watched, read, listened to. I'll be glad to take your recommendations and opinions of recent things you stumbled upon :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI listen quite a lot to youtube videos whose audio I scrape, mostly talks and lectures. Podcast I've been listening recently to are Andrew Huberman's *Huberman Lab* podcast (I'd describe it as \"applied neuroscience\"; he's very careful with the statements he makes and has a nice voice) and David Harvey's *Anti-Capitalist Chronicles*. I used to listen to quite a lot of Zizek in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent films:\r\n\r\n\r\n*The French Dispatch*. Because I love Wes Anderson, admire his attention to detail, I'm hesitant to say that I liked this film but was a little disappointed. I liked it less than any of his others. At the same time, he was experimental here in ways new to him and there's one thing that \u2013\u2013to me significant\u2013\u2013 distinguishes it from him previous work, so I tell myself that it's a turning point for him and he needs time to find his new vision. It's also possible that I'd like it better on a second viewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n*My Octopus Teacher*. I didn't like the narration, nor the style of the film, but I found it interesting. More than it taught me something about octopuses, it taught me about humans.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Never look away*/ *Werk ohne Autor* \u2013 loved it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaundry list of other recent movies I watched and loved: *Dolor y Gloria* (Pain and Glory); *\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442* 1 and 2; *Microhabitat*; *Gespenster* (Ghosts); *Kr\u00f3tki film o mi\u0142o\u015bci*; *Wife of a Spy*; *Pirosmani*.\r\n\r\n\r\nI no longer see \"favourite\" to be very useful a term in this context, but for whatever it's worth, for a long time I considered *Lost in Translation* to be my favourite film. I remember when I first saw a poster for it, though I first watched it much later, when it came out on DVD. The attention the poster evoked in me probably has to do with the title and my then Japanophilia \u2013\u2013 the title was translated in Hebrew to \"Lost in Tokyo\"; is this irony or art? Later \"my favourite\" became \"Adaptation\", which I find very close to my heart. Either way, I'm looking forward for Sophia Coppola's and for Charlie Kaufman's next films. As well as those of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks: the last book I read was *Cloud Atlas*. It was recommended by my aforementioned encouraging writing teacher, years ago, and had long stood on my shelf unattended. For some reason I thought I wouldn't like it (that there was a film based on it probably had, I must admit, something to do with it) but I was quickly captivated once I started. I loved it. Also, recently:\r\n\r\n\r\nAuster's *The New York Trilogy*, which I loved (and have too much to say about).\r\n\r\n\r\nI read most of Franzen's *Crossroads* but abandoned it towards the end. I had enjoyed it enough that if it was not the first of three installments I would have finished it. It's greatest offense was being under-edited (look who's talking, you might say!) and so I didn't care to go on. I did love his *The Corrections*, however. Generally, I'm trying to cultivate the habit of abandoning books that I don't enjoy and whose only promise is a sense of completion by their end.\r\n\r\n\r\nI loved Morrison's *Beloved*; Ishiguro's *Never Let me Go*; Plath's *The Bell Jar*.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad ambiguous feelings towards Zalkow's *a brilliant novel in the works*.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust started McEwan's *On Chesil Beach*, loving it so far; am at the midst of Mazzucato's *The Value of Everything*, finding it very informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEver since my WG turned into a Zweck WG (planning to move out) where I'm the only one eating at the kitchen, on days I work from home, I watch series. Currently watching *Breaking Bad* and *BoJack Horseman*, loving the latter in particular. Loved *Rick and Morty* (but who doesn't?) until that season when it wasn't it anymore. I suspect *The Wire* will nonetheless forever stand at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I do programming I like to listen to fast paced loud music such as that of Ling Tosite Sigure, Lightning Bolt, Igorrr. When I want to fondle my ears I listen to Animal Collective, Do Make Say Think, Amon Tobin, Mr. Bungle. The advice given to Charlie in *Adaptation* is \"wow them at the end\", but when I finish personals ads I end on a melancholic note.",

    ProfileText: "Eli Tyre\nDating Profile\nI'm a straight man,\nyears old.\nI live an intense, pseudo-ascetic, life, focused on altruistic work, self-improvement, and personal-spiritual integrity. (Additional detail on my unusual lifestyle can be found\nhere\n.)\nI'm looking to go on dates with new people, with the possibility of long or medium-term partnership. I'm open to both monogamous and polyamorous relationships.\n(More photos\nhere\n.)\nWhat I Want\nI\u2019m attempting to live with an\nopen heart\n, robust ethics, and scrupulous epistemic standards. Above everything else, I want relationships, romantic or otherwise, that support and nourish me in that.\nI'm open to two pretty different flavors of relationship:\na low-time-commitment, high-intimacy, companionship, on the one hand,\nand a high intensity, high commitment, long-term Partnership, on the other.\nMedium term - Once-or-twice-a-week companionship\nCurrently, I\u2019m mainly looking for more companionship in my life.\nI would like to have someone to spend time with about once or twice a week: talking, circling, co-working or strength training, cuddling, having sex, being curious together, all with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other.\nThis kind of relationship amounts to approximately what poly people call a \"secondary partnership\": emotionally intimate, but not the primary structure of one's life. This might work best for someone who already has a primary partner, or who is otherwise committing most of their energies to a high intensity project.\n(\nThis somewhat-out-of-date document\ngives some ideas for what that could look like, given my focus on my work.)\nLong term - High intensity Partnership (with a capital P)\nIn the long run, I\u2019m looking for a\nspiritual collaborator\n*, for the other half of an\naltruistic power couple\n.\nI want a Partnership with someone relentlessly and ambitiously dedicated to improving the world, who is striving to grow in skill and wisdom, and who will mutally support me in doing the same. A relationship in which we work together, train together, rest together, and help each other to live in integrity with our values. This entails, among other things, spending a lot of time working.\n(Some more operationalization of what this kind of relationship might look like\nhere\n.)\n* - To be clear, I am an atheist and an antitheist. It is an extremely important fact about the universe (and about my worldview) that we are\nbeyond the reach of God\n. But I am deeply concerned with matters of the spirit, no matter that souls turn out to be implemented by neurons.\nConstraints and relationship-essentials\nWork\nOut of a combination of personal inclination and moral commitment, I work a lot\n. I spend the majority of my waking hours at the office working, training, studying. In between work blocks, I exercise, eat my one meal a day, and nap.\nAnyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with that, either because they have a similar orientation to the world themselves, or because they\u2019re chill with a relationship that is intimate, without being time-intensive.\nHonesty\nThe thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty.\nI've sometimes been in a context where there was a\nforbidden conversation\n, some true fact, or some belief I held, that I didn't feel free to acknowledge\u2013because it would offend someone, or because it \u201cwasn\u2019t my place\u201d, or because pointing out some farce would make things worse, or because it seemed like it was intruding on the other person, who didn't want to hear it, etc. In a situation like this, I feel pressure to pretend about, or distract from, or downplay the thing.\nI\u2019ve come to think that I can\u2019t build a robust relationship on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, up to and including all of things that it is usually not polite or acceptable to say.\nCreating those kinds of contexts by merely\nintending to be honest\nisn't sustainable. It requires skill to say the things that can't usually be said, in a way that doesn't do undue harm.\nI make explicit considered effort in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback) in a way that the other party can hear it without feeling attacked. And I\u2019ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty,\nNonviolent Communication\n,\nrationality\n, and\ncircling\nskill.\nBut even so, I am not a master at this. I still sometimes find myself in situations where there's something that feels too awkward to share even in otherwise candid relationships. I need help to maintain this kind of connection.\nIt is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: that it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what\u2019s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward. This is crucial for me in an intimate relationship.\nMeta\nRelatedly, relationships with me typically involve a lot of \u201cmeta\u201d: doing checkins, talking about the relationship and how it is or isn't working, flagging frictions and generating creative solutions together, investing effort trying to improve our communication processes, etc.\nSome past partners have found this onerous or annoying. \u201cCan\u2019t we skip all the process talk, and just do the cool things that the relationship is about?\u201d I don\u2019t see it that way. Much of what I care about in a relationship is the strength of the relationship itself, and this sort of meta and process-iteration is a means to that.\nCompletely unironically, leaving comments on my relationship-communication google docs is one of my love languages. (The google doc format is optional. That's just a communication method that has worked well for some past partners.)\nRelationship style\nI'm dispositionally monogamous, generally preferring to commit to only one person. However, I am happy to date people who have other partners themselves, especially if I can see that that makes them happy.\nI have only ever seriously dated one person at a time, and incidentally, I have only ever seriously dated people who were poly. (Effectively, I was monogamously partnered with someone who was dating other people.)\nI am more than willing to participate in a fully-monogamous partnership, if we're a good fit. I've dated poly people, not because I particularly prefer poly, but because the people I've been interested in have been poly.\nKids\nRaising kids appeals to me, but I\u2019m not currently planning around having a family in the pre-singularity. However, I would do that if I found a\nhighly\ncompatible partner and having kids was important to her.\nThat is to say, I am\nopen\nto having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.\nI do have strong views about schooling and education.\nI think that I am unusually committed to the good, which is probably somewhat heritable, and the world would be better if there were more people in it like me. If you wanted my sperm, without parental obligations, I am\nlikely\nopen to that, though I can probably suggest even better candidates.\n(I think I will probably actively seek out a partner for raising a family after humanity is out of the\nacute risk period\nand life extension is solved.)\nSex\nSex is more important to me in the case of a once-or-twice-a-week companion than in the case of a committed Partnership. The point of having a capital-P partnership is mostly to help each other be better. For that, sex can be nice, but it isn't necessary. In the case of a more casual relationship, sexual and intimate emotional satisfaction is a larger fraction of what I care about.\nI\u2019m interested in doing deliberate practice to get good at sex: focusing on my partner\u2019s experience, with ample verbal and nonverbal feedback (plus after-action debriefs). It would obviously be better to do this with an emotionally-intimate partner, but I'm potentially open to trying with someone who I'm not otherwise dating, if we can establish really good communication and clarity about expectations first.\nVegetarianism\nI'm vegan (with\nsome caveats\n). So far, 100% of the people that I've dated seriously and 100% of the people that I've ever been in love with have been vegan. This is mostly correlation\u2014the sort of people that I tend to be attracted to tend to be vegans. But it's\nalso\ncausal\u2014I care about the ethics of the people I spend time with. For most people, eating factory farmed meat is the habit that causes the most direct harm to others. (Additionally, seeing someone eat meat tends to reduce my level of attraction for them.)\nI'm not confident, but I think I probably don't want to date people who aren't vegetarian, or who aren't otherwise careful about the externalities their life has on animals in factory farms.\nI'm not listing this as a firm deal-breaker, but it is important to me. If you eat factory farmed meat, and we get moderately far into dating, I'll want to have an honest and reasoned conversation with you about the ethics and tradeoffs involved.\n(I'm conscious that abstaining from animal products entirely is not a healthy choice for some people, and that there are additional tradeoffs.)\nSome notes about the kind of person I'm looking for\nI tend to like, and like spending time with, people who embody some combination of unusual moral commitment, high emotional/relational skill, and intellectual aliveness.\nSome concrete, non-exhaustive, positive signs (both causal and statistical) that you might be the kind of person that I like...\nYou're vegan \u00b7 You've done more than 20 hours of circling \u00b7 You donate a largish-fraction \n  of your income, or did at some point in your life \u00b7 You majored in (or autodidacted) a STEM subject, or philosophy \u00b7 You don't drink alcohol \u00b7 You have a personal \n  practice of Gendlin Focusing or parts-work \u00b7 You were an EA before 2021 \u00b7 You've reflected seriously on ethics and integrity, and \n  have some provisional conclusions which guide your personal choices \u00b7 You prioritize exercise and \n  physical health \u00b7 You were raised in a Jewish household \u00b7 You write a blog about ideas \u00b7 You've read (most of) the LessWrong Sequences \u00b7 You \n  invest heavily in personal development \u00b7 You identify as libertarian \u00b7 You identify as anarchist \u00b7 You enjoy or have been involved with musical theater \u00b7 You \n  distinguish between the social justice issues that are rolling moral catastrophes and the ones that \n  don't matter \u00b7 You have at least one private or public writeup of how you think about ethics or a particular \n  ethical decision \u00b7 You journal regularly \u00b7 You consider \"having true beliefs\" to be an ethical imperative\nYou absolutely don't have to match all of that (or even most of it!). If you value similar things, consider reaching out. : )\nSome friends' descriptions of me:\nFriend 1:\n\"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.\u201d\nFriend 2:\n\"Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at.\"\nFriend 3:\n\u201cEli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.\u201d\nIf you want to say hello...\nIf any of the above sounds interesting to you, or even if you just want to say hi, \npress\nthis button\nto tell me your name and a few sentences about you (or just email me\nhere\n). Maybe we can meet up the next time\n\t\twe're in the same metropolitan area.\nI'm grateful to everyone who takes initiative and reaches out, even if it turns out we're not a good match. In\nan important way\n, your \n\tdoing that is the only reason this system works at all. So thank you.\nIf you would like more detail about who I am, or what I care about, you might explore the rest of this site, particularly the\npublic statements page\n, or flip through my\nblog\nand/or\narchived twitter threads\n.\nAid my quest!\nIf you\u2019re not a good match with me (you\u2019re male, or married, or want something different than I do), but you'd like this project to succeed, \n\tyou can help by connecting me with thoughtful, single (or non-polysaturated) women who want the sort of thing that I want.\nIf you took even 5 minutes right now to flip through your facebook friends and consider if any of them might want to date someone like me, you will earn my\ngratitude\n.",

With art always asking myself \u201cWhat are stories worth telling?\u201d.  Also connected with the broader Effective Altruism community. I have found plenty of wonderful friends there.\r\n\r\n\r\nI care about truth\u2122. Would love to eXplore how we think about the world through dialogue. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of learning + working it can happen that I sometimes spend days without leaving the house. But co-working with great people is also socializing, right? ^^\r\n\ud83d\udd0e What I am looking for\r\nYou?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neXploring more love. I think I have more to give.\r\nI want someone to cuddle and love.\r\nAnd to receive love and eXplore life together.\r\nCreate a shared protopia (prototype utopia).\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my love languages is definitely touch. I enjoy giving (back-) massages. Learned how to do that professionally once and it has been a great life skill ever since. Friends can attest :p  \r\nJust great moments of mutual relaXation. Good stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n[some more ideas around deal-breakers and potential mutual interests at the end of this doc]\r\n\ud83d\udd7aShort Term\r\nBeing Hedon Buddies - yeah would be open to that\r\nAlways happy to go on a fun date with someone even if \u2018nothing more\u2019 emerges from that\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoly:\r\nWhen I created this doc in early 2023 I wrote \u201c\"Polysecure\" is on my (long) reading list. Would bring it to the top of my reading list for the right person :D\u201d\r\nWell that is funny! I guess I did find the right person and did end up reading that book (and many others). I have been in a poly-relationship lasting since Summer 2023. So going over a year and going well. \ud83d\ude42 Feels very much new to me though.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMy partner and I with 2 amazing friends\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked my current partner to leave a note here. This is what they had to say on the fly:\r\n \u201c10/10 would date again\u201d (they have edit access to this doc if they ever wanna change it :D)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf1e Long Term  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHmm eXpectation setting: There is space in my life currently for up to 6 dates a month I guess. Like if I actually look at my calendar and my plans.\r\nIn the long term I would like to introduce you to my partner. I want us to be chill around each other. To be fair this would be the first time dating 2 people at the same time. So I would just be open to eXploring and communicating what works for us. So I don\u2019t have clearly detailed plans for this yet. \r\n\r\n\r\nBelow you can read what my romantic single self had to say in early 2023:\r\n\r\n\r\nI want us to encourage each other to become better. Grow together[a]. Which could also just mean that most of the time we are both each other's comforting recharging resting place.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am deeply inspired by this impressive elderly couple who wrote a free book[b][c] after ~50 years of marriage. They both work in nuclear proliferation and had to first 'create peace within their relationship before bringing it to the rest of the world'. Our relationship might not look at all like theirs and we don't have to work on the same problems but I would want both of us to contribute to the world in some way or another while our relationship will contain a great amount of laughter and kindness - so we can be a shining star for others \ud83c\udf1f\r\n\r\n\r\nKids: I don\u2019t feel like getting kids right now. On the other hand I would not be surprised that with the right person I could imagine starting a family in the neXt 3 - 10 years.\r\nBut I could also see that I can scratch that itch by becoming a teacher of some sorts (e.g. professor, mentor or being the funny uncle^^). I am currently not feeling like I am missing something and I can see myself never having kids and still living a flourishing happy fulfilled meaningful life. But I (naively) think having kids can be a beautiful thing.\r\nThis would be something I would love to think through and eXplore together after a while. Let's see what feels right.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be honest I am eXcited about the neXt relationship (hence this doc). Each year I learn more about myself and forms of communications (and have become a better friend of mine as a result \ud83d\ude0a). I can see how that knowledge would just help greatly in a relationship.  (Things I read about and/or where I participated in workshops: Non-Violent Communication, Double CruX, Street Epistemology, intrinsic values, CBT, mindfulness, ask vs guess vs tell culture, consent games, \u2026)\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nI am living in Lichtenberg-Berlin. If you are in Berlin or around that would be cool!\r\nBut everything in Germany that is reachable via train could be nice.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I am in and around London at least once a year.\r\nCould see myself making 1 week long trips in Europe for the right person given that I work remotely.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am kinda eXcited about the idea of having lovely connections in different parts of the world. Places to come home to in a way. But I can definitely see how this might be in conflict for you/me to be the building block of a committed relationship. \r\n\ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\udc91 Date Ideas\r\n\u201cFor picnic and picnic related dates, press 1\r\nFor creative and drawing activities related dates, press 2\r\nFor \u2026.\u201d\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nLeft: bike that seats 2 for shared picnic trip\ud83e\udd68\u2615, \r\ncenter: #cruisin\ud83d\udef9, \r\nright: fun with body paint, probably better for third, fourth or n-th date \ud83d\ude05\r\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c What am I doing with my life\r\nAm a researcher and team coordinator at a not-for-profit research org where I look into fun-stuff such as nuclear winters (but mostly support my brilliant colleagues). Currently, I have reduced my hours to eXplore more creative ways of adding value to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nI build art eXhibitions that deal with the future. Watch Facing Moloch on YouTube if you like! \r\nI also enjoy imagining what if we get it right. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am concerned about Global Catastrophic Risks and Existential Risks and devote a significant part of my work/life/art to contribute to these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I also wanna have fun in the meantime. Live fully / intentionally.\r\n\ud83d\udcdc Credentials\r\n\u201cYou are the most optimistic doomy person I have met!\u201d - random conference attendee in Prague\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cwarm & kind person, great friend\r\nreconciles being scientifically minded and being deeply artistic \r\nforward and systematic thinker who cares about flourishing of humanity \r\nCreative about grasping Zeitgeist and Ideengeschichte in art \u201c - close friend\r\n\u2753Potential deal breakers[d]\r\non leaving the house/city for nature\r\nI guess I don\u2019t go much into nature out of intrinsic motivation.\r\nI love going to lakes for swimming.\r\nAm happy to take a run through a park or go on a bike tour in the forestry greeny lake-rich outskirts of Berlin. But I only occasionally seek these kinds of activities on my own.\r\nI wonder if I have that impression right now just because the last few months I have been recovering from a sports-injury .\r\n\r\n\r\n(I have got passions for lifetimes to pursue just with internet access at home \ud83d\ude05)\r\nSo if you are seeking someone to retreat into the woods you have some convincing to do. But maybe you are the dryad to lure me into the forest ^^\r\n\r\n\r\nTraveling\r\nI don\u2019t fly around as much (as some of my friends). I have some sort of deeper ingrained belief around responsible spending and carbon footprint and a cluster of 'something feels off'.\r\nBut I do make eXceptions for projects / work which I deem valuable. As a result I get to visit Europe's capital cities for conferences. In 2022 I was in Paris, Prague, and London (+ a couple of German cities). In 2023 I added Warsaw and Vienna to the list. Usually adding a few days around events/conferences to eXplore the city and visit museums or meet-up with people I normally only interact with online.\r\nGenerally, I prefer vacations which are reachable via train.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet\r\nI am vegan around 98% of the time. 2% vegetarian are from eating at restaurants and families where there are no convenient vegan options. I would prefer for you to be vegetarian or vegan.\r\nAlso, potatoes are the best! Here have one and rejoice \ud83e\udd54\r\n\r\n\r\nDrugs\r\nCaffeine in the form of coffee mostly. Occasionally, but increasingly rarer, a beer. You do you \ud83d\ude42  But taking drugs together is not a date idea I am interested in.\r\n\u2795Bonus\r\nYou like nerding out about music (I like prog-metal music among many other genres)\r\nI love discovering new music\r\nI also enjoy sharing music, so if you are open to new stuff that would be cool. \r\nWould love to hear why you enjoy a certain style / artist / song. \r\n\r\n\r\nI find it inspiring when people are eXpressing themselves and are turning an emotion into art. Dancers, musicians, painters, poets. If we are getting together, chances are high that I will draw you (like one of the french girls). \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\n\r\nI admire it when people can think clearly, decouple concepts, eXplore ideas, and communicate well. Scientists, coders/programmers, writers. Let's update our models of what is actually going on. Does your map fit the territory? \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to get to know me - Awesome! Feel free to ping me:\r\nSignal: aeXplorer.12000\r\nTelegram: @globalcatstrophicrisk\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to let me know if you missed something from this doc or think it could be improved somehow \ud83d\ude42\r\nHere is my Admonymous link for anonymous feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading all of this! Here is a poem as a token of gratitude:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToDo\r\n* insert songs and playlists I enjoy\r\n* ???\r\n* profit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[a]If I recall correctly the growth mindset has been debunked - but it is still something that feels intuitively good / right.\r\n[b]\"A New Map for Relationships - Creating True Love At Home & Peace On The Planet\" https://anewmap.com/\r\n[c]It is basically NVC + some funny anecdotes about geopolitics and the couple. But I just loved learning about them and how they both together want to do good in the world and thrive doing so.\r\n[d]or deal-makers - depending on your preferences ^^",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffJulian Deep Dive\r\n(Last updated Feb 2025)\r\n\u201cI love you & love being your friend for so many reasons & highest among them is that by feeling, thinking & talking with you I can begin to refuse that which does not serve me. You ask questions and share ideas but, beautifully, all of the movement and growth and opening is me, my own. Things are so shockingly possible and I\u2019m so grateful to be realizing that with the help of your beautiful example and brilliant thinking-with. All my love. \ud83d\udd06\u201d \r\n-T, a dear friend & confidant \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nBringing \u201cnow do a fun one\u201d to weddings everywhere. \r\n\r\n\r\nOnline dating profiles can be limited and imprecise, so I jotted down a bunch of personal information that should make this process easier. I\u2019ve also enabled commenting access on this doc in case you\u2019d like to discuss any areas directly. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find this sort of writeup weird or off-putting, that\u2019s okay \u2013 I wish you luck in your search! But if you appreciate that it saves us time and avoids potential future confusion/sadness, read on! \r\n\r\n\r\n(The topics written below are unlikely to change, but I am open to huge flexibility within their lines and to clarification when unclear or indeterminate. If any specific questions come to mind, please ask them :) \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cOne summer, Julian skillfully navigated his way to a caribou roast at a cabin mere miles from the arctic circle. I was his plus one and will be telling this story until the end of time. Not for our journey in a rental car to this small Alaskan bush town with no cell service, not for the epic love story of the lovely couple who hosted us, but in awe of how my friend Julian\u2019s generosity, authenticity, and curiosity in others lead to the moment where we stopped in the road, locked eyes with a caribou, and realized how magnificent the world is.\u201d \r\n-Emily, a dear friend. [Editor\u2019s note: I believe it was actually a moose.]  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhy do I call him \u201cTiny\u201d? Because he\u2019s my newt! \r\nAt a glance: \r\n* 31 years old\r\n* 6\u20190\u201d\r\n* Born & raised near San Francisco, CA\r\n* Culturally Jewish but not religious\r\n* Reasonably fit & athletic\r\n* B.A. in Philosophy from Yale \r\n* Autistic & nonbinary (and does relationships sapphically) \r\n\r\n\r\nCore values:\r\n* Curiosity, creativity, and open-mindedness (which include adventure, exploration, and experience)\r\n* Humor & fun\r\n* Honesty \r\n* Kindness and helpfulness (not to be confused with niceness)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cJulian is a very cool and unique person and I can confirm they are not like Amber Heard or anything traumatic/yikesy/holy-shit-what-was-that-esque and are safe to date. No weird surprises or court cases with this one! 10/10, (would not date again though of course because we were wrong for each other, but figuring that out was easy breezy lemon treesy, plus I have since met the person I\u2019m going to marry and do recommend that experience and think everyone should try it, 5 stars, and I enthusiastically hope Julian finds their life partner too, as they are a mega dope human and they deserve a happy ending, goddamnit!)\u201d\r\n-Jane, a former partner who is lovely and kind and who clearly wrote this while following the Amber Heard / Johnny Depp trial \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cJulian makes life more fun. He is also impressively good at most things. The sex is also enjoyable. He also has a lot of feelings and they are very big. Just thought you might want to know that too.\u201d\r\n- Nikki, who has asked to be referred to as \u201cthe love of my life and one who got away\u2026 wait, I\u2019m still here!\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nCurrent Funcle seeking promotion to Fun Parent. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m Looking For (in no particular order)\r\n1. A primary life partner. I would like to commit to putting a single relationship above all others. I would like my partner to be fundamentally interested in doing the same with me.\r\n2. Openness to exploration and creativity. This interest is both cultural (eg I spent the first 4 months of 2023 traveling through Australia and Asia, and 3 months recently in Europe) and social (I love meeting new people). I thrive more than most people when I feel free; I suffer more than most people when I feel trapped. To that end, I\u2019m interested in forming a relationship that is fundamentally tailored to our individual needs (rather than one that fits some standard archetype). \r\n3. If I have kids, I would like to spend much of my time focused on them. I have thusfar built a life that would enable me to follow this passion, and I would like a partnership that enables me to do the same. \r\n   1. I. Love. Kids. I like acting like a kid, I like playing with kids, I like being around kids. I like the feeling of holding a child; it\u2019s more absorbing than any other feeling in the world. (Note: While I\u2019m not in a rush (as finding the right partner is more important than speed), I would enjoy having kids soon :) \r\n4. I enjoy caring and giving. I love the feeling of really, truly, deeply caring about someone \u2013 I\u2019ve experienced it once romantically before and I would like to again, both with my partner and with my children. I would also like my partner to have a similar/parallel emotional experience about me. \r\n5. I want a partner who I experience as kind and generous and accepting. I have many uncommon traits that I would like to be appreciated/valued/loved. These traits include: \r\n   1. Autism \u2013 medically diagnosed; had a big impact on my childhood; these days many people I meet wouldn\u2019t even guess but it\u2019s still meaningful\r\n   2. Transness (which includes taking estrogen (more on this below). \r\n   3. Being a wandering soul \u2013 I\u2019ve lived in a van for 5 years, changing city a few times per year. \r\n      1. Re this traveling topic, I would like to find a partner who either A) also enjoys living in new places, or B) joins on some adventures while otherwise living in a place that I find sufficiently satisfying that they can serve as a \u201chome base\u201d as I explore. (I love NYC. I lived in Manhattan for 6 months of 2022 and 6 months of 2023. I would enjoy being a \u201csuper snowbird\u201d.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI was still relatively new to stand up [comedy], and took encouragement to my heart. Julian offered to come and then take me out to steak dinner after a show, and Julian, a man of his words, followed through. After the show we walked around the corner to where his van was parked, where he then proceeded to cook me a steak himself on a campfire burner, handed me a plastic fork and paper plate, and said that he\u2019d give me a knife but his dog Smidgen had licked all of them. It was one of the best steaks I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d \r\n* Matan, a kid from the youth group I used to mentor. [Editor\u2019s note: I believe some of Matan\u2019s details to be apocryphal but left the story unedited to let the love shine through.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTraits I have that I find attractive (attempting to be accurate and clear rather than show humility)\r\n* Intelligence and a unique perspective\r\n   * Most people who talk with me find me one of the most interesting conversationalists they know.\r\n   * I have been told that I am very much myself. If you like my perspective on the world, you're likely to love it because it's so amplified. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Humor\r\n   * I enjoy jokes, teasing, and funny art. My favorite painting is a portrait of a pig. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. The piece recently moved to Pennsylvania and I\u2019d love to see it again.\r\n   * If I tease you or riff with you, it\u2019s intended affectionately. People have different styles (and New Yorkers are often very literal). If you have a different style, no worries \u2013 I enjoy open communication here. \r\n\r\n\r\n* Intensity, competitiveness and drive\r\n   * I\u2019m a competitive person. I\u2019m generally very skilled at card games, board games, and sports. I\u2019ve also applied this strategic skill to succeed in many areas of my professional and social life.\r\n   * I find properly-placed aggression and intensity to be incredibly sexy. I\u2019ve received the feedback that I\u2019m particularly skilled in bed; this is not mere happenstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Direct communication & a high degree of honesty\r\n   * I rarely lie \u2013 certainly much less than nearly everyone. I\u2019m also much more precise with my words than nearly everyone.\r\n   * In a comfortable container, I can be both logically precise and profoundly emotionally vulnerable. If this tickles your fancy, we\u2019re going to have a good time.\r\n\r\n\r\n* A high amount of self-knowledge and the ability to self-malleate when needed.\r\n   * I\u2019ve intentionally changed some significant parts of myself. I can do this with a speed that often surprises others. I only do this when it aligns with my values (eg when I find a trait of mine is preventing me from achieving something that I care about more). I like that this ability allows me to grow quickly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I first met Julian, I had never heckled a single person in my life, especially not with a megaphone. There I was, a virgin burner swept away in the dust and heat, when he scooped me into his presence. Within minutes, with Julians help, I was screaming \u2018hey you with the weird hat, come get some quesadillas!\u2019\u201d \r\n-Geoff, a friend who I met at Burning Man \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nMy friends sometimes draw me :) \r\nQuestions you may have\r\n1. Are you interested in marriage?\r\n   1. Short answer: yes. Longer answer: I am interested in a primary, committed, preferred-above-all-others life partnership for which the formal contract of marriage fits well. I\u2019m in no rush, however, and am only interested in getting married once. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. How many kids? \r\n   1. I would enjoy having a large family (4+ kids). I am also open to having the standard american size (2-3). \r\n   2. I have previously frozen my sperm and would enjoy having biological children. I am not wedded to this preference but it is a relatively strong one. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. You\u2019re taking estrogen? Why? Are you planning on \u201ctransitioning\u201d?  \r\n   1. I began exploring my gender in September 2021 and it dramatically increased my life satisfaction so I started taking estrogen in May 2022. Since then, I have stopped and restarted estrogen on 3 occasions to see whether it is a preferable way of existing for me. It is. By a lot. \r\n   2. I don\u2019t know where this exploration will end up. My current expectation is that it will take me to the femme side of nonbinary. There\u2019s also a chance I will go all the way to transfemale. \r\n      1. I\u2019m learning as I go, realizing an increasingly clear vision of my ideal self, and I\u2019d like to have a partner who enjoys and values this sort of self-exploration. \r\n   3. I have previously dated people who preferred the masculine elements of me and disliked the feminine. This is not a recipe for a thriving relationship. As Daniel Sloss puts it, I\u2019m looking for someone who loves all of me. (If you\u2019re a straight woman looking for a man, look elsewhere!)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. What gender(s) do you date?\r\n   1. In general, I find myself attracted to androgynous- or feminine-presenting people. The most accurate one-word description of my sexuality is \u201clesbian\u201d. \r\n   2. Queer women are a great fit! 10/10, no notes :) \r\n   3. Nonbinary people are also great! (I have less experience dating nonbinary folks than queer women but it\u2019s possible that\u2019s more due to historical pool size around me than actual personal preference.)\r\n   4. Regarding other genders: \r\n      1. Despite gay men frequently finding me attractive (presumably because they see me as queer and a man), this has not historically been a good combination (presumably because they\u2019re wrong about the latter). \r\n      2. I\u2019ve never dated a straight man. I doubt it would work, but maybe? \r\n      3. Straight women have not historically fit well with me, presumably for gender-based reasons. Also, I have found they tend to exhibit these straight-rom-com-esque traits, all of which I dislike: \r\n         1. An implicit preference for emotional uncertainty instead of direct communication\r\n         2. Expectations of/desire for chasing and being chased, persuasion and being persuaded, and manipulation to fit a mold instead of respect for individual flourishing. \r\n         3. A lack of creativity/queering/outside-the-box thinking. (As a friend put it, \u201cstrict heterosexuality is a failure in imagination\u201d.)\r\n         4. Passivity rather than self-reflecting on their preferences and realizing those desires. (As one straight female friend recently realized at age 36: \u201cI\u2019ve spent my whole dating life standing on a street corner waiting for suitors to appear\u201d.) \r\n   5. Many of my habits and preferences (eg around conflict resolution) simply align better with queer culture. This may simply be due to the fact that queer culture is more experimental and closer to the forefront of relationship dynamics, or it may indicate a fundamental queerness in myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Are you monogamous or non-monogamous? \r\n   1. I have dated in monogamous relationships and I have dated in open relationships. I have a slight preference toward open (partially because I don\u2019t like the feeling of trapped-ness), but it is not core to my being. \r\n      1. The most successful relationships I have embodied previously are ones  similar to the structure practiced by most of my gay male friends: one stable primary partnership with large leeway (nearly complete permission?) for external relationships, with the common knowledge understanding that those external relationships will have no detrimental impact on the partnership. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. You live in a van?! Are you\u2026 well\u2026 poor?  \r\n   1. No. \r\n\r\n\r\n7. This doc is intense! Are you always this intense? \r\n   1. Many of my friends would describe me as lighthearted and fun. (One friend says I\u2019m the funniest person he knows \ud83d\ude07.) That said, when the situation calls for it, I can be very, very intense. Since this doc is a braindump of important topics, it\u2019s designed to be clear rather than beat around the bush, so I guess it\u2019s intense \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \r\n   2. If you\u2019re curious what I\u2019m like in real life, let\u2019s grab coffee or a videochat to see if we enjoy talking. In dating as in most areas, if we agree on the general vision of where we\u2019re going (which is what this doc aims to do), I\u2019m not super fussed about the details/timeline and am happy to move at whatever day-to-day pace feels comfortable. \r\n\r\n\r\n8. Why did you write this doc?\r\n   1. I want to ensure I know what I want.\r\n   2. I want to ensure you know what I want. \r\n   3. I want to save time and avoid unnecessary emotional turmoil for both me and others.\r\n   4. I bet it\u2019s a damn good filter.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Anything else I should know? \r\n   1. That's probably enough for now. If you want to read all of the friend testimonials, you can find them here \ud83d\ude02\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cJulian invited me to my first burn event. One night, a casual game of foosball evolved into Julian schooling opponents in game while educating them in philosophy, like watching a TED talk if the speaker was presenting from a stolen Miata during a high-speed pursuit by both local and federal authorities. The moment drew a crowd instantly. Julian just shits art wherever he goes. I've never met someone more serious about fun.\u201d \r\n-AJ, a dear friend \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nMe & my seester, the day she graduated from business school \ud83d\ude3b\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou should have a little reward at the end for anyone who finishes reading this. Like a \u2018hey, congratulations, have a cookie\u2019 but a metaphorical cookie.\u201d \r\n-my friend Micha\u0142\r\n\r\n\r\nHey, congratulations, have a cookie: \ud83c\udf6a\r\n\r\n\r\nContact me: pitter.patter.precisely@gmail.com",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffKNOW SOMEONE WITH WHOM I\u2019D BE A GREAT MATCH?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact details:\r\n* tyronebarugh+dating@gmail.com\r\n* Twitter DM to @barughtyrone\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for:\r\nI am looking for a relationship with a woman between 25ish and 35ish who:\r\n* is high-energy, agentic, altruistic, humorous, passionate, and smart;\r\n* wants two (or more) children, the first in the next 2-3 years;\r\nThis doesn\u2019t mean I would expect my partner to be the primary caregiver. I\u2019d happily take on - or share - that role, especially if my partner\u2019s career was a big focus at that time.\r\n* has a secure or anxious attachment style;\r\nI think the attachment style concept is probably only directionally correct, and wouldn\u2019t superficially rule someone out on the basis of some avoidant traits. Equally, I think that something approximating the \u201canxious-avoidant trap\u201d is a pretty likely failure mode for my romantic relationships and I\u2019m fairly keen to avoid that.\r\n   * wants a monogamous relationship; and\r\n   * ideally wants to live most of the time in New Zealand or Australia (although I am flexible on location, and regular visits to New Zealand could also work!)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a bit more about me:\r\n   * I\u2019m a 29 year old cisgender man. For our present purposes, I\u2019m basically straight (I think I\u2019m mostly heteroromantic but bisexual).\r\n   * I\u2019m from Wellington, New Zealand, and am about to return (mid January) after spending half of 2022 living nomadically.\r\n   * I am a lawyer, but might not practice law indefinitely. I\u2019m motivated by the principles of \u2018effective altruism\u2019 (a social movement that encourages using reason, evidence, and an \u2018expected value\u2019 mindset to do the most social good we can).\r\n   * Until recently, this mainly caused me to secularly tithe 10% of my income to effective charities (I\u2019ve taken the \u2018Giving What We Can\u2019 pledge), although more recently I\u2019ve also joined the increasing number of effective altruists making changes to their career plans to increase their impact. Right now, I\u2019m trying to ensure that effective altruism organisations spot and manage legal risks that could limit their impact.\r\n   * As a partner, I\u2019m very dedicated and put lots of effort into the relationship. A flipside of this is that I can be quite emotionally needy - while I take responsibility for my emotional wellbeing, I expect to rely on my partner a lot for reassurance and to feel safe. I think I\u2019d be a good fit for someone who wants a really close, serious partner - and a bad fit for someone who wants an element of casualness long-term.\r\n   * Running hurts my knees, but I love cycling. I\u2019m really into skiing, and never grew out of going ten pin bowling. Day hikes are great, although I really like going on a multi-day hike with someone close and having a chance to have long form, meandering conversations over a few days. I\u2019ve recently bought a VR headset, and playing fitness games like \u2018Beat Saber\u2019 increased how active I am on rainy days a lot.\r\n   * A major hobby of mine is \u2018law as performance art:\r\n   *  I garnered the support of multiple legal academics in my bid to become the sole legal seller of cow\u2019s milk in Wellington, New Zealand in reliance on a long forgotten law from 1919.\r\nhttps://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/thepanel/audio/2018836032/the-pre-panel-with-scott-campbell-and-sarah-sparks \r\n   * My \u201ccredentials and\u2026 enthusiasm to practise in the field of Pitcairn Law\u201d were described as \u201cimpressive\u201d by the Chief Justice of Pitcairn Island, who proceeded to decline my bid to be enrolled as a Pitcairn Island lawyer.\r\n   * I successfully fought to be naked in my passport photo.\r\n   * I like informative podcasts and videos. I like to know a little bit about everything, and would really value a partner who shares a curiosity about nearly everything. An exception to this is stuff that requires strong spatial awareness - e.g. learning how machinery works. I really struggle with this, and don\u2019t find it very interesting.\r\n   * I am trying to think more quantitatively and more clearly - I am interested in the \u2018rationality\u2019 project popularised in places like Lesswrong, but think \u201caspiring rationalist\u201d would be a fairer label than \u201crationalist\u201d.. \r\n   * I\u2019m perpetually confused by my personality, but the formulation a psychologist gave is that most things can be explained by the value I put on my close relationships - and also, I suspect, the universality with which I project that onto other people. I have a deep well of feelings in this regard. I bawled at age 11 watching the romantic comedy \u201c50 First Dates\u201d, and I\u2019ve been unable to bring myself to watch the movie \u201cLion\u201d (about an Indian boy adopted into an Australian family who goes to find his birth family and culture) because the trailer made me too sad. \r\n   * People usually think I\u2019m jovial, or even flippant - I was described by another lawyer once as \u201cvexatious\u201d, but that was more a function of his need to touch grass than my personality. In contrast to that external presentation, I quickly dial that down when someone needs support, or when there is serious work to be done.\r\n   * Big 5 personality test results:\r\n   * 96 on extraversion\r\n   * 96 on openness to experience\r\n   * 87 on agreeableness\r\n   * 85 on neuroticism (trying strategies to reduce this)\r\n   * 64 on conscientiousness (ADHD diagnosis, although I think fairly well managed)\r\n   * I am concerned about animal welfare and factory farming. May go vegetarian or vegan in the future, but currently instead choose to offset my moral harms by donating to highly effective farmed animal welfare charities.\r\n   * I have well controlled eczema. The way I keep this controlled, however, is semi unpleasant. I cover my entire body in emulsifying ointment before bed, which means I can be a bit sticky right afterwards. I wear long pyjamas, but nice linen will still get ruined pretty quick. My partner will inevitably be exposed to second-hand moisturiser. I do expect this to improve in the future; my dermatologist says that biologic drugs are available now and improve things heaps, but I don\u2019t meet the current funding criteria for them in New Zealand. Once this becomes widely available, I\u2019ll be less sticky - and, crucially, I\u2019ll be able to surf and swim as much as I like!\r\n   * I was previously obese (around 125-130kg), and am now overweight (98kg). My weight has been trending down fairly consistently, and I expect that it will plateau around 90kg.\r\n   * I\u2019ve got pretty powerful legs, probably from carrying around a big load for a while. (I love hiking now, because it\u2019s like I\u2019ve lost more than an entire hiking pack\u2019s worth of effort.) I have heterochromia in one eye, which I reckon looks pretty cool. And an extra vertebra!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotos:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\tI use this photo for Linkedin, for work Slack channels, and as social proof that I can be serious in professional contexts if I really have to.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tThis is one version of the good life - blue skies, a freshly stained deck, and a flourishing veggie garden in my suburban NZ backyard. I\u2019m not necessarily wedded to this version of the good life, and would love to know how my weekends might be different with you.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tI don\u2019t take many photos, so haven\u2019t got a snap of my favourite suit. But a colleague did, and included it in my farewell card from my old job.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tI like diving, skiing, cycling, and hiking.\r\n\t  \r\n\r\n\tFair warning - my hair might end up like this again some day!\r\n\t  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\tI love any opportunity to poke fun at the silly implications of things I sincerely believe. This year\u2019s halloween costume was \u2018rats on heroin\u2019, one implication of my belief that we should reduce suffering.",

It\u2019s grey. It has been since I was 13. I like to see this as a feature - you can experience the social opprobrium of dating an older man, without me being tied down by things like a house or a sports car.\r\nCharisma\r\nI don\u2019t know how one writes about this in a way that doesn\u2019t come across as obnoxious. People say I\u2019m charismatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve hosted like 20 dinners.\r\nI did a rap on a train once.\r\nI started a project that got on wikipedia\r\nBlunt\r\nI\u2019m working on this, but I am blunt and spiky at times. Accuracy is very important to me and I\u2019m frank about money, sex, ambition, feelings. Some people really dislike this.\r\nLoquacious\r\nI love to have conversations. I text. A lot. I will definitely call you back first. I may be cycling at the time[2].  Hopefully you\u2019ll find this touching rather than annoying. But if you don\u2019t like being bothered.. \r\n\r\n\r\nI dated someone once who could spend the whole evening in silence. Reader, I did not marry her.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I like to talk about:\r\n* Nothing. I like shit chat. I like blanket statements, pillow talk and complicated wordplay. I like to take dad jokes and push them father. My aim is not to be very funny on average, but to be very funny on aggregate.    \r\n* Feelings. I like to process how I have felt. About conversations and plans. I want to hear how you feel and what you want. I want to know you and be known by you. My sense is that fact is more interesting than fiction and that humans are more interesting when they are less mysterious. I know few people I don\u2019t like and with almost everyone I can find something fascinating.\r\n* Everything. I like talking about policy, effective altruism, forecasting. How to run the country, how to run the dishwasher, how to run away from this strange man who won\u2019t stop talking. It\u2019s all good stuff\r\n* You. If we were to date I would want to make you more like you want to be. I\u2019m pretty intense but if that\u2019s your thing then I want to be on your time. I want to help you in your job, your art, your mental health, your relationships with friends and if you want, lovers. \r\n\r\n\r\nI struggle to stay focused on one thing. If you want that. I\u2019m not for you.\r\nFriends and relationships \r\nI used to be an evangelical Christian and in the last few years have got really into effective altruism and forecasting. It\u2019s quite a switcheroo and I have a wide range of friends with a variety of worldviews as a result. I love community - I think and talk about rationalism, EA, neoliberalism, whatever tv show I\u2019m watching.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, I have lots of friends and move in a wide circle of people - I\u2019m often going to parties or visiting Durham for a week etc. etc. I\u2019d love for you to come with me but if that\u2019s not what you want then if it\u2019s a good match in other ways, I imagine we can figure something out\r\n\r\n\r\nMy default would be monogamish/an open relationship but I\u2019m open to discussing. I want to have a life partner but be able to connect with others occasionally. Integrity is really important to me and I have had trouble in the past with guilt around being flirtatious. I don\u2019t want that. I\u2019ll be honest and I\u2019m willing to be flexible, but I also want to be kind to myself. \r\nWho might be a good fit\r\nSome words that jump to mind\r\n* Curious\r\n* Playful\r\n* Honest\r\n* Intelligent\r\n* Kind\r\n* Patient\r\nFor balance\r\nI am very biased[3]. Some of my exes had a great time dating me, a couple did not. If you know any of my female friends, feel free to ask them for the details. I don\u2019t want to paint an overly rosy account.\r\nWhat next?\r\nIf any of this sounds good, reach out!\r\n\r\n\r\nOr share with a friend. I think I make clear the kind of person who would be a good fit and those who wouldn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\r\nDM me on twitter or email me at nathanpmyoung@gmail.com \r\n\r\n\r\nIf something I could change turned you off, I\u2019d appreciate anonymous feedback at https://www.admonymous.co/nathanpmyoung \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want a song that feels like dating me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc3Jo65Lct4 \r\n\r\n\r\n________________\r\n[1] I am also, not like all the other girls. I have a NSFW blog, which you can ask for by messaging me including the word gubernatorial or like, figuring out how to find it \r\n[2] This is probably the most stupid thing I do\r\n[3] Based?",

Will do at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find grace and being kind to those who are hard to be kind to beautiful, although sometimes I do get down and honestly just dislike people and think some people will never change, and all that stuff and blah blah blah. Nuance/disclaimers aside, I'm looking for someone who is primarily just a person of love in this crazy world. I am not a fan of a tendency towards outrage, mockery, and being offended all the time. I\u2019m generally more interested in exploring the gray areas + pros and cons of all sides than I am in aggressively choosing a side. I am not very prone to anger and can talk about almost anything without taking it personally. I think I\u2019m fairly good at taking criticism, especially if it\u2019s done with care/love, but have room to improve too. Hopefully if I can find someone like me, communication will be lightweight and relatively easy and free, and we will be able to talk about just about anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am interested in all sorts of things, including the big existential question \"what _are_ we?\", the brain, consciousness, etc. I am agnostic and fascinated by it all. The absurdity of this existence gets me. The fact that we just find ourselves alive one day in this insane world / story we are living in with no memory of how we got here or what's going on in a giant universe with no sure signs of anyone else being around is a freaking trip. I can see things from a scientific and rational perspective, and I am also a very loving person with a sense of wonder about the nature of reality, etc. The exponential growth of technology and this perhaps incredibly pivotal sliver of time we are born in is also crazy and fascinating.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am interested in spirituality / if there is any sort of bigger, cosmic force out there / some sort of bigger reason why things will turn out okay, but I don\u2019t spend much time on it. It\u2019s hard to know exactly how that would fit together with all sorts of animals living short lives of seemingly excruciating suffering, and just all of the pain in the world in general, etc, but I enjoy having the hope and wonder anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite this semi intense bio, I am a bit of a goof and am very easygoing. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am always willing to change my point of view and admit when I realize I am wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nI enjoy all sorts of things. Apart from just connecting with others whether it be from deep conversations or watching something heartfelt together, I think a couple of things I should mention specifically are physical activity and physical touch + sexuality. Someday, I would like to learn how to hang glide if I live somewhere where this is possible. Snowboarding, longboarding downhill, and all sorts of of other fast paced athletic things sounds awesome as well \ud83d\ude42 Maybe I can do that thing where you snowboard with a deployed parachute someday \ud83d\ude01\r\n\r\nI would like a partner where we can strive to be our best selves together, help the most people / do the most good, capture the most life and experiences, and hopefully and motivate each other on a sacred journey to be as impactful as we can be. I generally like to spend most of my time being productive, and love having a mission. I hope we are on the same page here and it won't bother you too much if I\u2019m on my laptop a lot multitasking on a project or something while we watch TV, or you are reading, or whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find the end of this video starting at 43:30 to be very powerful, and I hope it resonates with you in some way or another: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY&t=43m30s\r\n\r\n\r\nI like humor about things being awful or something I can't quite pinpoint, lol. I'm certainly okay with dark humor as long as it's not malicious. Here's one: https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/s/9BvFjVRTqQ\r\n\r\n\r\nStoof:\r\n- Born May 15th, 1990).\r\n\r\n\r\n- 5\u201d8, 165 Lbs, but this is subject to change:\r\n- I have run or biked basically every day for the last 7 years. Have been weightlifting for 6 months as of April 2024 and am in it for the long haul.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I plan on moving away from the city I\u2019m living in someday, which is Lubbock, Texas. I\u2019m open to meeting people who live far away from me right now and someday moving to be closer to each other. My son\u2019s mom will have to be a part of any decision as to where me and my son will move, however, but she is on board with getting out of our current city. Asheville, North Carolina is a town we both think could be cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I ideally would not like to have more kids, but could perhaps someday.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I have a preference for a monogamish relationship / open relationship that tends to be mostly monogamous in practice where we are still \"each other's person\" (not ownership. Deep love)\r\n\r\n\r\n- I would still be very happy with monogamy if we had a very strong focus on purpose in life and helping others.\r\n\r\n\r\n- I\u2019m not sure I would want full on poly / a group relationship. Dating separately could probably be okay, but it might be nice to live in some sort of non poly community if so, so that I didn\u2019t have to just be alone at the house when my partner(s?) wasn\u2019t around. I\u2019m not sure how much this is actually appealing to me though. Then again, I don\u2019t want to place hard rules on each other and want to allow each other to be free as much as possible, so I would be okay with not having things be like mandated by rule that other relationships need to be limited to some small scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been doing property management. Was going to try getting into software development and using my CS degree, but found it hard to find a job in this market, and honestly, I have some mild ADHD and would struggle with a job like that unless I was able to take a nap during mid day and have a couple of hours where my brain feels exhausted and I don't get much cognitive work done. If I\u2019m able to nap though, I\u2019m normally great for the rest of the day. I used to be Christian and have a lot different views. I actually thought not worrying about money was a virtue, lol. I wish I worried about it more. Nevertheless, I\u2019m well on my way towards financial freedom with my investments. This is lame, but some day I have an inheritance coming. Probably another reason I was never worried about money apart from just wanting to strive to help others and do something with myself. Right now though, I\u2019m just getting my commercial driver's license and am going to be doing local delivery truck driving. Not very glamorous, but I love driving and this will give me energy for the rest of life. If software developers are in demand when my son is slightly older and takes less time, I\u2019ll get a remote software developer job where I can take a nap and work a schedule that works for me. I am working on a stock trading thing as a software side project.\r\n\r\nIf you are a very type A person, we probably wouldn't be a great fit. I'm pretty laid back.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy son's mom doesn't want to be together because I\u2019m not Christian. She wants me to \u201cfind Jesus so we can get married\u201d. She thinks highly of me and we coparent and work together great for our son. I have hesitations about being together with her that I won't get into here. This always sucks and obviously isn't great vibes to talk about. I\u2019d be happy to talk about it not over text though.\r\n\r\n\r\nHonestly I\u2019ve had some moments in life that have really brought my shortcomings to the surface. Situations I wish I would have handled better. I\u2019m certainly a normal person with my own struggles, downsides, etc. When circumstances are bleak, I am subject to depression. Having had an honestly difficult young child had been a huge test of patience at times, and there have been extremely challenging moments, and then there are absolutely beautiful moments at other times. At least it has helped me to further develop my patience. My son is getting older now, and really sweet moments are on the rise, and challenging moments are on the decline.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have only one child \u2013 A  son who turned 4 years old on September 17th, 2023. I assume this will be seen as a downside by most potential partners.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am extremely understanding of shortcoming due to weakness, sadness, etc. Less so of aggression, or just poor overall character. I like to differentiate between being a good/bad person and being a functional/high performing person. \r\n\r\n\r\nFairly low on neuroticism - probably the most scientifically established, objective thing that leads towards good relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nFairly high on agreeableness, which has some downsides and I have to make sure I don\u2019t let people take advantage of me, because it\u2019s really hard for me to just say \u201cnot my problem\u201d when people are in a bad situation, but this trait is supposed to make for good relationships.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact & misc:\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can message me on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/kevin.wheeler or email me at kevinwheeler90@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can find my OkCupid profile here: https://www.okcupid.com/profile/16703780554927230141\r\nIf you have any feedback for me, perhaps about how this document could be better, please feel free to send it.",

He genuinely wants to be there for other people. I\u2019ve seen him show so much openness to emotional connection in times when even other resilient and emotionally mature people would have been inclined to take a step back from their existing relationships. I\u2019ve never seen stonewalling or apathy from him. Quinn always cares, and is excited to show that he cares. If you have the same love languages as Quinn, he\u2019ll be able to make you feel super special. Being there for other people and caring doesn\u2019t just mean caring about his friends or partners\u2014he also shows up for communities. At a party, he\u2019s either the host or the guy you assume is the host because he introduces a new burst of energy to each room he\u2019s in.\nQuinn also has a super strong sense of self; he won\u2019t passively fall into trends. I\u2019ve never heard him be insincere or mocking. When so much media and so many conversations contain at least a little bit, and sometimes a lot, of mockery, Quinn has a refreshingly firm focus on topics where he can be completely sincere. Basically, it feels like the idiom \u201cbig-hearted\u201d was invented to describe Quinn.\nTraits to make me swoon\n\u200b\nSincerity\nAnalyticalness\nConviction\nCompassion\nAmbition\nIntrospectiveness\nIrony is poison.

Mainly canceled them because I went on a long trip, but plan to resume monthly rather than weekly as things stabilize.\nSwam from alcatraz to SF.\nReally psyched about work, generally enjoy being someone who works a lot.\nAlmost entirely vegetarian.\nBaby fever, but don't do a lot of thinking about my parenting values because I'd rather do that thinking as a group project with a special someone.\nOften singing and humming, hopefully a turning a loved one's name into song.\nI have at least two mysterious backstories.\nYes the kidney tshirt is real.\nOne secret zest for life / high hedonic setpoint trait/behavior that it'd be more fun to surprise you with.\nReach out\n\u200b\nEmail:\nquinn.dougherty92@gmail.com\nCalendly:\ncalendly.com/quinn-dougherty\nWould love to pivot to signal > sms > element/matrix > telegram > some mutual slack we happen to both be in after a brief exchange.\nOpeners / conversation menu\n\u200b\nAffection styles / love languages\nYour (least?) favorite failure mode of \"Radical Honesty\" -adjacent practices\nAssembling furniture with someone: is this\ninherently\nhorny behavior or dependent on context?\nHow you think about the poly vs monog question\nOne of your \"strong view weakly held\" current childrearing beliefs/strats that you want my help to double check as a research project.\nTestimonial by my dear friend Gavriel\nTraits to make me swoon\nType of guy\nReach out\nOpeners / conversation menu\nSocials\nLessWrong\nEffective Altruism Forum\nManifold\nGitHub\nSite built at Tue Jan 21 2025 19:56:53 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time).",

A mix of creativity, spirituality, and grounded practicality, I\u2019m seeking someone who values meaningful connections and shares my values of ethical living and personal growth\r\n* A mix of introverted and extraverted tendencies, I enjoy a balance of socialising and quiet time. I prefer small gatherings or one-on-one conversations over large group discussions\r\n* Vegetarian, I eat 95% vegan, with the occasional vegetarian meal/snack when abroad/visiting\r\n* Somewhat frugal, partly wanting to save money (and perhaps retire early), partly because I value simplicity\r\n* I care about my impact on the world and moral implications of my actions\r\n* My main love language is physical touch and I\u2019m curious about exploring Tantra more\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I do/like\r\n* Go to self-developmental/spiritual workshops/events and embodiment practices like Moving Connections/Contact Improvisation or occasionally ecstatic dance. \r\n* Organise and facilitate meditation groups and retreats\r\n* Learn about psychology and understanding human nature\r\n* Hike in nature; I also walk a lot around the city, everything within an hour I\u2019d call easily walkable \ud83d\ude42\r\n* I like animals and enjoy pet sitting which I do as a side hustle (my main job is data analyst)\r\n* I used to travel quite a bit pre-pandemic, however these days I value more building community where I live\r\n* Draw, craft and/or paint portraits of my friend\u2019s pets \ud83d\ude42\r\n* Read books, both fiction and non-fiction\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I don\u2019t often do\r\n* I\u2019m not much of a foodie - I batch cook and don\u2019t mind eating the same thing for number of days; I usually prefer to spend my time, money and energy on other things\r\n* Sporty things - I enjoy gentle activities like hiking, cycling, and swimming, but I\u2019m more focused on the experience rather than athletic achievement\r\n* I rarely drink alcohol and don\u2019t watch streaming services much\r\n\r\n\r\nLife ideas:\r\n* I would like to have 1-3 kids, ideally starting within the next 2.5 years\r\n* I\u2019d prefer to move out of London to a more nature-connected or communal environment to raise a family\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m looking for\r\n* Someone emotionally available and responsible, who values transparency, open communication, and believes that love is both a feeling and a choice\r\n* Spiritual yet grounded and rational\r\n* Playful/compatible sense of humour\r\n* I appreciate partner who is mindful of my ethical choices and would be open not to eat meat and fishes in front of me; I feel the need to disengage emotionally in these situations and I wouldn't want to be disengaged emotionally around my partner\r\n* Open to having child(ren) within the next 2.5 years\r\n\r\n\r\nA few caveats\r\n* It might take me some time to get used to someone and build trust.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffAs of early 2024, I\u2019m currently in a stable committed relationship and am not looking for a new partner.     \r\n\r\n\r\nHi! I\u2019m Meredith. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\n* I\u2019m a 34, straight, monogamous woman living in Oakland\r\n* I drink socially; I don\u2019t smoke; I don\u2019t do drugs.\r\n* I\u2019m somewhere between 5ft 6in and 5ft 7in tall.\r\n* Descriptive words: bubbly, passionate, smart, kind, fun, confident, friendly\r\n* I want biological kids. Note that I\u2019m a carrier for cystic fibrosis, so bonus points if you know you\u2019re not a carrier. \r\n* I\u2019m comfortably liberal, particularly in the classical sense of that word. I often find I\u2019m arguing the conservative position in the Bay Area, and the liberal position elsewhere. I read Matt Iglesaias, Astral Codex Ten, the NYT (sorry Scott), and The Dispatch. I also listen to approximately one bajillion podcasts. \r\n* Enneagram 2\r\n* Meyers-Briggs ENFJ \r\n* According to my unprofessional self-assessment of the Big Five: I\u2019m high in conscientiousness and agreeableness; and moderate in openness and extraversion. I\u2019m probably also moderate in neuroticism (I tend to run anxious, but have it well managed at the moment.)\r\n* A deeply committed Christian only looking to date other Christians. (Wish me luck!)\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies: I love reading, and probably read a book a week on a wide range of topics from sci-fi/fantasy to pop science to women\u2019s literature. I enjoy cooking and good food, and like to make delicious healthy meals on the weekends to have leftovers all week. I try to stay active, and enjoy hikes / the outdoors; morning jogs; and Zumba or Yoga classes. I\u2019ve been teaching myself how to play the guitar (fingerpicking style) for a bit over two years. I still identify as a beginner, but I am having a great time and have made a lot of progress. I bought a condo last year, and practicing hospitality is an important part of my life. I enjoy trying new things and special events; for example, I just signed up for a glass flameworking class at the Crucible, and regularly go to Broadway musicals at the Orpheum with a grad school friend. I got scuba certified earlier this year, and love being underwater; I\u2019d like to plan my next trip to go diving! \r\n\r\n\r\nI try to give back as an expression of gratitude. I tithe and also give on top of that, as I like the ideas of effective altruism (although a lot of effective altruists would probably disagree with my priorities as they\u2019re biased by my faith). In addition to money, I try to also be generous with my time; I make space for volunteering both in and outside of my church. For me, gratitude is the appropriate response for the privileges I have received in life (spiritually, monetarily, personally); and the manifestation of gratitude is generosity. I believe, and experience, that a life lived generously leads to joy. I seek out joy in my day-to-day decisions and circumstances! \r\n\r\n\r\nProfessionally: I got my PhD in Chemistry at Berkeley, and now work as a project manager at Genentech. I love my job, as it\u2019s a great combination of helping people work together better and learning more about how biology works \u2013 and developing the next generation of medicines to help patients. I\u2019m currently working on how I can grow in supporting community-owned solutions to challenges (rather than pushing through a solution that works best for me), and that is a satisfying self-improvement endeavor. My career is very important to me, although I\u2019m typically the kind of person who leaves work at work. I believe in work-life balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheology: I am Protestant, reformed, egalitarian, mostly conservative/orthodox in my views (of note, including around issues of sexuality). My favorite theologian is NT Wright; I also respect Tim Keller and CS Lewis. I enjoy debating theology, and don\u2019t need to have complete theological alignment with a partner; but I do need mutual respect, and openness to female leadership in the church (because I\u2019m open to a call to be an elder, etc, in my future; and I don\u2019t want to get in a place of needing to choose between my spouse and a call from God). Outside of that practical matter, I remind myself that we\u2019re saved by Christ, and not the correctness of our theology. Various prayer practices and time spent in Scripture are an important part of my faith. I believe that faith should be put into action through both holiness and service. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou: I\u2019m looking for a smart, attractive, fun, Christian man who is confident enough to stand up for what he believes; humble enough to change his mind; and comfortable in his own masculinity. The ideal man for me would be self-aware, compassionate, and striving to be more like Christ. I want a partner in life \u2013 the kind of person who makes me better, and who is better because of his relationship with me; and the kind of person who is a great friend, present for the big and small moments of life. Mutual attraction and physical affection are also important to me. \r\n\r\n\r\nSend me a note if you\u2019d like to connect!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTop: Diving in the Maldives\r\nBottom: Me with my sister in a hot air balloon",

To embrace one's passions, interests and what's fun (in the Richard Feynman sense). I find inspiration in David Deutsch's notion of\noptimism\n: that all goals are either impossible (due to laws of physics) or achievable given the right knowledge. And therefore that every moment is an opportunity for learning and growth, even amidst failure and setback. That creativity is our greatest, most precious asset and the bedrock to an infinite potential for progress.\nAnd so, I'm looking for partner to make progress with! To cultivate a life long relationship to be deeply proud of and moved by.\n///\nPhilosophy/Values\nMy core interests are philosophy, science & technology, and the arts.\nI value philosophy, science and technology generally as I find them one of the best tools for guiding and refining our thinking, promoting the growth of knowledge, and shaping cultural progress.\nThe arts, however, are closest to my heart. I believe they have an immense potential for promoting joy, connection, reflection, novelty, fun, empathy and expression.\nWhile the others are primarily laymen/outsider interests that I am not an expert in, I do have an art school background (BFA).\nI live for finding and cultivating beauty, celebrating the joy and precious idiosyncrasy of others, reducing suffering, improving flourishing and leaving an impact wholly true and distinct to yourself.\nTo know my work, whether it be humanitarian or artistic: a portrait, a piece of writing, a film, song, or game could live on for others to cherish is a beautiful and precious opportunity.\nWork/Projects\nI currently work as a freelance video editor and creative professional. I try and align to clients that match my values and ideals.\nOutside of freelance, I have a passion project developing an all-ages adventure game fable (as a tribute to\nMiyazaki\nand what I view as the immense artistic potential the medium holds.) Given the complexity of this project, however, this is something I imagine working on gradually throughout my life.\nI also have a YouTube\nchannel\nwhere I occasionally develop video essays.\nMy studio practice is important to me. I believe one's life is an art work and of developing a body of work you're proud of. :-)\nRelationship Style\nI'm seeking a thoughtful, creative relationship where we can bounce ideas off each other, have compelling conversations, share, critique and support each other's work. To collaborate, challenge each other, develop and strengthen shared values and make progress together!\nLet's make art, music, write and play games together. :D\nI've come to realize I have a much more romantic orientation overall, built on love and shared values. Sexuality, passion and intimacy is nice, but genuine care and connection is far more important.\nI'm a big fan of sincerity and transparency and dislike small talk and sarcasm. I believe in commitment to sharing each other's problem situation out of love and respect.\nGender/Aesthetics\nI tend to think people are complex and can't be put in stereotypical boxes. There are characteristics of both masculinity and femininity that I respect and find worth cultivating. I tend to dress in a more masculine fashion, though I also want to start building a more vibrant and fun fashion sense.\nI am attracted to a more feminine aesthetic, have only dated women to this date and am primarily sexually attracted to women. That said, I am open to dating other sexes. More-so than anything, genuine connection and shared values seem to be a key factor for attraction greater than sexuality. In this sense, you could call me a romantic.\nEthics\nI went vegan after watching the documentary \"Earthlings\" and Peter Singer lectures, and now work on a vegan ethics podcast called \"\nSentientist Conversations\n\" which focus is:\nevidence, reason and compassion for all sentience\n.\nI'm not opposed to dating a non-vegan, as I myself was one and I recognize it is quite a novel movement historically speaking and not a cultural norm, but it is important to me and I do believe it represents moral progress.\nInfluences\nI have a soft spot for the beauty of\nArt Nouveau\n, the fun of\nadventure games\n, the rich imagination of\nStudio Ghibli\n, and the bold unwavering optimism of\nStar Trek: The Next Generation\n. ;-)\nGoogle Sites\nReport abuse\nPage details\nPage updated\nGoogle Sites\nReport abuse",

    ProfileText: "\ufeff@rmushkatblat / Robert Mushkatblat\r\nEmail: bobert.mushky@gmail.com\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery Short Summary\r\nChild of Soviet Jewish immigrants, software guy, calm.  70% predictable from archetypes.\r\nA Little Less Short\r\nOccupation: lesswrong.com\r\nOrientation: Straight / Monogamous\r\nTraits poorly predicted by archetypes:\r\n* I show up to things on time, don\u2019t miss appointments, and file personal taxes well before the deadline.\r\n* I appreciate fine dining and tea (as artforms, not merely as hedonism, though that\u2019s good too).\r\n* I drink infrequently (maybe 5 times in the last year?).\r\n* I dance (international latin ballroom).\r\nPersonality: Most comfortable in groups of 2 - 6, care a lot about those things that I focus on (ethics and aesthetics both); have sometimes been called a snob (affectionately).  Not a huge fan of super loud events, though I like the occasional prog metal concert.  I like to share my joy in food with friends & partners, and figure out what they like well enough to remove the need for them to exert any sort of mental effort on making decisions in that domain if they want.  (Food is not the only thing, just a good example of how I relate to people.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m Looking For\r\nPersonality:\r\nDespite my archetype (high-decoupling nerd male software engineer), most of my closest friendships rest more on personality fit and mutual openness + support, rather than shared careers, interests, or hobbies (excepting rationalism).  Which is to say I spend some time talking about software or x-risk with friends when off the clock, but not most of it.  I probably would not have predicted those particular friendships ahead of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, important components have been:\r\n* Ability and willingness to discriminate between factual disagreements and values differences.  See: high-decoupling.\r\n* At the same time, not being strongly focused on contentious but intractable domains, like mainstream politics\r\n* Having an even temper.  Many other personality traits have been highly variable; e.g. I have quite a bit of practice supporting people through bouts of imposter syndrome.\r\n* Actually deeply giving a shit about something.  I\u2019m not sure if this is causal but it sure has been a common thread.  That something is not always something I personally care about a ton, but it\u2019s generally intelligible to me.  Examples: the flourishing of the local community one grew up in, exploring the limits of communication styles & bandwidth for another\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nSocialization:\r\nI like small things more than big things.  My tolerance for size increases when I know more of the people.  Quieter is better than louder.  Unstructured is better than structured - I\u2019m not big on board games or movie nights (\ud83d\ude2c) but do like spontaneously-occurring pockets of discussion.  These are derived from how I\u2019ve felt across many different events, activities, and relationships, and exceptions certainly exist.  Of course, the kind of relationship I expect to be healthy anticipates occasions where we meet halfway and and those were we fly solo, depending on context.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am basically happy to pack my calendar full of socialization, obligations permitting - I\u2019ve yet to run into situations where I was turning down opportunities to socialize because I\u2019d had enough rather than because I didn\u2019t have the time, or because I didn\u2019t expect to enjoy myself doing that particular thing.  However, I wouldn\u2019t feel particularly bereft if I spent a week at home, if I was doing something useful with that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren:\r\nAt least one, and would want to see how the first one goes before deciding on more.  Pessimistic about traditional education, mostly due to personal experience, and would pretty strongly prefer defaulting to homeschooling or thoughtful co-op arrangements.  Ultimately, though, would want to defer to whatever actually worked best for the kid, as the person with the most introspective access relevant to the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintenance:\r\nI take care of myself reasonably well and happily outsource other things (e.g. house cleaning).  I do have aesthetic preferences about my living spaces but put a pretty heavy penalty on things that add significant overhead in terms of time and attention.  I find doing tasks in this category much easier with another person than doing them alone, but don\u2019t want to over-promise.\r\nInteresting things I\u2019ve done (or have happened to me):\r\n* I wrote the first long-form HP/f!TMR[a][b] fanfic (it\u2019s not actually great, but it is completed)\r\n* Got as far as \u201cfinished MVP and launched\u201d with a startup while working full-time\r\n* Have been stung by jellyfish three (3) times and lived to tell the tale\r\n* No longer keep track of how many times someone has said \"this is the best thing I've ever tasted\" or similar after taking them somewhere new\r\n* Speak mother tongue near fluently (\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439)\r\n* Flexible enough to do things too disturbing impressive to be written down\r\n\r\n\r\nHobbies (and how to get to know me):\r\n* Ballroom dance (international latin ballroom, could use a partner)\r\n* Choir\r\n* Tea (currently exploring aged whites)\r\n* Run LA rat meetup (I continue to be semi-active in the Discord server)\r\n* Food (my FTC profile, for my writing in a totally different social context)\r\n* Glowfic\r\n* Used to spend time helping people get better jobs (mostly software)[c]\r\n[a]love you for saying this / admitting that you write fanfic <3\r\n[b]<3  it was a big part of my life!\r\n[c]how's this working out now?",

I\u2019m leaving this page up for posterity and those curious about things like this, but am removing it from my site\u2019s header as I am now in a relationship with someone.\n(And yes, they\u2019re someone who filled the form out \ud83d\ude42 )\nGood luck to everyone else out there looking for love!]\n(I have\ntestimonials\nnow!)\nJanuary 1st marked the start of my\nnewest season\n, Romance. Overall my life is pretty fantastic, but I\u2019m still looking for a long-term relationship, preferably on my way to marriage and at least one bio-kid within the next couple years. So I picked this season to really commit to that goal in every way I could think of, which includes things like just, you know, openly saying\u00a0 to everyone who might find me interesting \u201cHey, I\u2019m single and looking to date\u201d and seeing what happens.\nSo if you\u2019re here, maybe you\u2019re interested in me based on my writing, or passions for rationality and psychology and fiction. If so, great! Those are things I enjoy talking about, so we\u2019d probably get along well.\nThe quickest way to my heart, however, would be if you\u2019re into some combination of rationality, video games, or writing. I say that because I\u2019ve always been a very \u201cactivities oriented\u201d boyfriend.\u00a0 I enjoy cuddling together with a pair of books or watching a show, but everyone I\u2019ve fallen in love with was through either playing games together, or co-writing/RP, or debating intellectual or philosophical topics.\u00a0 If the idea of spending hours doing those things makes you happy, then there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll be able to make each other happier together than we would be apart.\nThe other thing that matters a lot to me is personal development. I feel deeply driven to constantly learn, grow, and improve myself in every way I can.\u00a0 That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m \u201cType A,\u201d since there are plenty of days where I just chill and have fun, and girlfriends have said they find me relaxing to be around. But if I notice something isn\u2019t working for me or those I care about, I want to improve it, and I\u2019m pretty agentic in doing so.\nAll of which is to say, I want someone who wants to be that way too, and puts the effort in to learn how, both by improving epistemics and on the instrumental level of active problem solving. Someone who will be happy to help me improve more than I could on my own, and is looking for someone to do the same for them.\nIf you think that describes you, feel free to\nfill out this form\nand we\u2019ll see what happens!\nIf you already know me and are worried about \u201cruining the friendship,\u201d I can promise with very high confidence that won\u2019t happen. If you\u2019re worried about looking foolish if you try and fail, I can also promise that I\u2019ll always have nothing but respect for people who show vulnerability to reveal who they really are.\nI am doing this, after all ^_o\n(Also, I\u2019m willing to relocate for romance if things work out well. Meanwhile we can get to know each other online, and since I work remotely, I\u2019m happy to do short or long visits to spend time together if we hit it off!)\nIf you have found a spelling error, please, notify me by selecting that text and pressing\nCtrl+Enter\n.

Ze donated the bounty to the\nForesight Institute\n. We've been together since April 5th, 2022.\nCheck out\nour story on YouTube\n. And follow Carissa on\nFacebook\nor\nInstagram\nfor frequent updates on us \u263a\ufe0f.\nI'm very grateful for my friends\nAlton\nand Toli for adding this dating bounty to my initial parenting bounty! Check out\nToli's own dating profile/bounty\n! (And let us know if that causes you to date \ud83d\ude04)\nAnd let me know if you have a bounty of your own so I can help you, and add it here if you want \ud83d\ude42\nOther relevant writings\n:\nMy current lifeplan\nSperm donor profile\nBounty\nBounty: 3,500 USD\nI'm offering 2,000 USD\nfor someone I end up consensually being a legal parent with who you\u2019ve\n    introduced me to and who wasn\u2019t already a prospect. If someone reached out to me as a result of you sharing my\n    profile on social media, that counts too. Paid only for my first child.\nMy good friend\nAlton\noffered an additional\n      1,000\n      USD\nto support me \u2764\ufe0f \u2013 ze said:\nI'll add $1000 to the bounty for the referral of someone who is with you and brings you a lot of joy for 18+\n      months\n      because I love celebrating love. I'd want to have the option to have a 2 hour call with you both at that time\n      window\n      as a strong preference but not necessary.\nMy friend\nToli\nalso offered an additional 500 USD\nto support me \u2764\ufe0f \u2013 ze said:\nI will 50% match that bounty ($500) with the same conditions \ud83d\ude42 I don't know Mati *that well* (yet). But very much\n      interested in seeing him find a partner and taking apart how he did it\nHere's\nToli's own bountified dating profile\n(with a much larger bounty ^_^).\nA few more notes:\nIntroductions can be done through\nany channel\n.\nI can stop taking new submissions for this bounty at any time (but, obviously, not retroactively).\nThe money is to incentivize you to take the time to read my profile and recommend me to friends, and to\n      generally reward superconnectors which I think tend to be undervalued. The money is just a bonus on top of the\n      gratitude^_^\nVideo interview about my dating profile\nGeneral\nWhile I\u2019m open to other types of relationships, this profile is written with the goal of finding someone/people to\n    raise children with. I'm 32 years old (born in October 1990).\nI invite you to be yourself. I encourage you to not avoid doing anything you want to do in relation to me just\n    \"because it's weird\".\nFeel free to use\nReciprocity\nto see if we\n    match, or just reach out to me\n    directly.\nThere\u2019s some information I like to have about prospects early on that might be easier to do in a survey format, or\n    at least just so you know some specific explicit questions I generally have, you can see my\nDate me survey\n. Feel free to be very explicit and to the point with\n    me (or not). You can send me your own questions.\nLooks\nHere are some more pictures:\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/kLW4zMfwi7otDN4T7\n.\nI measure 188 cm (6'2)\nand weigh 87.1 kg (192 lbs).\nRelationship structure and attraction\nI\u2019m open to various structures, although I prefer if most of the relationship energy goes towards the family.\nI\u2019m panromantic. I\u2019m generally much more sexually attracted towards females. Romantic and sexual attraction is a\n        plus.\nRelationship\nI would like a partner with whom I can connect deeply\n, know each other very well and develop\n        great models of each other, share about what's going on in our lives, and be open about our internal\n        experiences. Provide support in each other's goals and aspirations, have each other's back, and deeply trust\n        each other, and care about each other. Giving each other's affection.\nBe a team working together\n. Defaulting to assuming any issues that might arise isn't being done\n        maliciously, and being comfortable bringing them up and collaboratively working on them. Being resilient, and\n        working hard to address any potential issues. Trying hard to not split / live separately while raising children.\n        Ideally being open to being lifelong partners, and if distance (emotional, physical, etc.) became wanted, still\n        remain there for each other.\nSpending time together\n. In terms of spending time together, I might lean towards spending a bit\n        less time together than the median couple. I like spending time with a partner by working on common projects,\n        talking about our day, cuddling, messing around, sharing meals, and doing exercise / sports. I\n        don\u2019t like to go out regularly, but maybe it\u2019s because I just haven\u2019t found the right activities.\nAbout me\nReviews\n. I\u2019ve had\nsome reviews\nwhich I think\n        are relevant here. I also had a very public relationship with\nCarissa\n, so checking our posts could give you some peak\n        into what being with me is like.\nValues\n. I\u2019m a very principled person. Honesty is very important for me. In terms of moral\n        philosophy, I\u2019m leaning towards deontological-threshold negative preference-weighted life utilitarianism.\nCommunication style\n.\nI lean ask/tell culture. I\u2019m rather\n          good at guess culture\n, and like using it sometimes, but it\u2019s important to me that my partner is able to\n        make their needs known explicitly if I fail at reading them, and be okay with me doing the same. I want someone\n        that is open to receiving feedback \u2014 I personally love feedback. I strongly dislike \u201cdeny culture\u201d \u2014 where\n        someone says something that I need to deny, instead of asking me. I\u2019m leaning more towards\ncold culture\n.\nFun\n. I like adventures and challenges. Not that I do those a lot, but I love them when I do.\n        Illustrative examples: I find it exhilarating to sleep naked in a cold forest, and I love doing DIY Impractical\n        Jokers (\nthis one\n          about dating profile\n\ud83d\ude05), exploring abandoned buildings, and doing food fights^^ I\n        generally like going\n        out of my comfort zone and trying new things. I like roleplaying. I like creating things.\nVibe\n. I'm often told I have a calming effect. I can inhabit other vibes, but I often inhabit\n        that one.\nHabits\n. I don\u2019t drink alcohol. I don\u2019t smoke. I don\u2019t take any drugs.\nKnowledge\n(outside profession). I\u2019ve read a fair amount about topics related to economics,\n        moral philosophy, futurism, effective altruism, LessWrong, rationality, and transhumanism.\nConflict resolution\n.\nHere are some\n          strategies I like to use\n.\nVideos\n. Here are recent videos of me:\ndiscussion with Malcolm\n,\ncircling\n,\nmore circling\n,\nauthentic relating games\n(biased sample\n        based on what\n        tends to be streamed).\nOkCupid Questions\n. I\u2019ve answered many\nOkCupid questions\n\u2014 most of them are\n        very old and a lot aren\u2019t up-to-date, but you can still check them out.\nMore\n. To know more about me, I invite you to go the traditional route \u2013 ie. stalking me; wait,\n        no, I mean 1 on 1 interactions :P. You can easily stalk me though; I notably have a lot on Facebook and on my\n        website (\nhttps://matiroy.com\n) \u2013 feel free to send a friend request. You can\n        answer\nthis survey\nto let me know other information you would like me to include on this profile.\nLocation\nI have a medium preference to work towards a US citizenship (ie. I\u2019m Canadian).\nI would prefer to live in Central or North America longterm, but short-term I'm more flexible.\nI'm totally okay with meeting remotely. I can also easily travel around, and will be travelling in the US\n        starting in April.\nChildren\nGenetic code and surrogate parents\nI would like to have children using embryo/gamete selection. Can I pitch you the idea? It'll be a fun conversation if nothing else^_^\nI\u2019m fertile: I\u2019ve done a\nsemen analysis and\n          donated sperm leading to 3 live births\n.\nI\u2019m also open to using surrogates \u2014 I think it could actually be valuable to have 2 (or more) children at a time.\nNumber\nI want at least 2-4 children\n, but my desire for the number of children scales almost linearly\n        with wealth, so I would like it if having 6+ children was on the table.\nUpbringing\nI would like to share responsibilities ~equally related to taking care of our children (money, time, etc.).\nI would like to have an au pair, nanny, and/or live-in maid, unless we\u2019re more than 2 parents / adults raising\n        our children.\nI have a predisposition towards liking giving a lot of autonomy / independence / responsibilities to children.\nI think it makes sense to give children the option to homeschool if/when they seem sufficiently\n        autonomous and if/when we have the capacity to support that. I can also see traditional schooling, boarding\n        schools, and other options being more valuable depending on our situation. I care about providing the tools for\n        our children to be successful.\nJust like I record all my life,\nI would like to record all the life of our children\n, at least\n        in some ways at least until they can make their own decision (because I think this might be important for\nidentity\n          preservation\n, as well as useful for\nother reasons\n).\nI would like to\n          sign up our children for\ncryonics\n.\nI would like our children to learn English as a first language.\nI might speak to them in French\n        so they also know French.\nI don\u2019t mind whether you or our children eat animal products, at least until they can make their own choices\n        (I\u2019m just mentionning that in case you know I have an\nbivalvegan diet\nand you were wondering).\nFinances\nYou can see my\nresume\nfor information on my career.\nI often think in terms of ROI when I spend money. I like saving a lot because of the\npower of\n          compounding investments\n.\nPersonality I\u2019m interested in\n(Which also corresponds to my personality.)\nMain traits I generally like (sort of in order):\nHonest\nValues living\nTruth-seeking; self-reflective\nProductive\nEmotionally stable; regulate their anger\nMentally healthy, low addiction\nIntelligent\nLongtermist\nTransparent\nCaring\nProsocial\nConfident\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the\ncomments powered by\n          Disqus.",

    ProfileText: "\ufeffDate me?  \r\n\r\n\r\n* Hello.\r\n* I am David.\r\n* Date me?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anything you read here resonates with you or makes you think maybe we should go on a date, message me! There\u2019s a lot of potential upside and very little downside.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to make one of these yourself, here is a template.\r\n\tVital statistics\r\n1. I\u2019m 30 and male.\r\n2. Mainly gynephilic, with some exceptions.\r\n3. I live in London and am pretty settled here.\r\n4. Poly (what's that?) with one partner (Amber) who I live with (her other boyfriend also lives here).\r\n5. Until recently I worked as a software developer; now I\u2019m running a conference on effective altruism\r\n6. I\u2019d like to have children.\r\nWhat I am like\r\n* Cuddly, warm, affectionate\r\n* I have a very calm disposition, low anxiety, low neuroticism, sometimes even a flat affect if tired.\r\n* Sometimes people can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m joking.\r\n* Quite laughy.\r\n* I don\u2019t think of myself as especially intro- or extroverted. I have been known to start chatting to strangers. I don\u2019t do well at massive parties where I know nobody (will bail and go home).\r\n* Often distracted by linguistic curios. (There was a period in my late teens/early twenties when I was distracted by the subject for 3 years.)\r\nThings I like\r\n1. Music. I studied the clarinet here for two years before deciding it wasn\u2019t the life for me. Here is some music I\u2019ve written. I\u2019m working on a new one at the moment. I\u2019m very lucky to have access to a piano at home, it increases my quality of life by a lot. I also sing in choirs and like going to small gigs (often folk).\r\n2. I recently started going bouldering and I think it\u2019s my new favourite thing.\r\n3. Writing silly poems.\r\n4. I\u2019m quite into effective altruism and thinking about ways to increase the impact I have on the world (mainly by donating money, and by volunteering my time as a software developer).\r\n5. Creative writing. Here is a post I\u2019m particularly proud of.\r\n6. I really, really like hugs.\r\n7. Improv games.\r\n8. Reading, particularly science fiction.\r\n9. Camping/hiking/the outdoors.\r\n10. Currently neglected hobbies: dancing, playing board games, drawing.\r\nWhat (I hope) you are like\r\nIf multiple of the below describe you, we should definitely at least chat. Each of them is a strong plus. But these are not essential, strict criteria. Far from it. They're clues. The most important thing is that we like each other and get on well.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou, my ideal person, are probably:\r\n* relatively nerdy,\r\n* like making jokes,\r\n* like to be physically affectionate,\r\n* like playing with ideas,\r\n* hold your opinions lightly,\r\n* are motivated to help others\r\n* and seek new experiences,\r\n* are curious,\r\n* and put in an unusual amount of effort to believe true things (\u2018good epistemics\u2019). \r\n* In terms of gender presentation, you probably are relatively mixed or neutral. I\u2019m most often attracted to women at the masculine end of the spectrum. Trans folk welcome.\r\n* You enjoy creating things in some way, whether in writing, artistically, or something else.\r\n* There needs to be an intellectual spark. For example, you enjoy talking about abstract ideas, gaining insight about the world, speculating, metacognition, building analogies, and delving into your confusion.\r\nForwardly Asked Questions\r\nWhy make a \u2018date me\u2019 page? What even is a \u2018date me\u2019 page? Where is your sense of propriety?\r\n* Dating sites are really bad at selecting for the kind of person I might want to date. But \u2018real life\u2019 is relatively good at this. I hope that by making this page I make it easier for people I meet in real life to know that I\u2019m open to going on dates, find out about what that might be like, and reach out. This is my way to let people feel empowered to make a move even if it might not work out. I am way too timid about these things myself precisely because I don\u2019t know if telling a friend I like-like them would damage our friendship. It would be tragic to miss out on a great thing because we were both too timid. So this is me giving you permission, and promising not to let it change our friendship.\r\n* Also, all the cool kids are doing it.\r\nWhat are you looking for in your romantic life?\r\n* Love. It\u2019s one of the greatest joys in life and makes the world beautiful.\r\n* While I\u2019m interested in exploring relationships at any level of casualness, I\u2019m most actively seeking something long term, ultimately to be one of the foundations of my life. Ideally, we would eventually live together.\r\n* At the same time, I don't want to fuse with another person; we'd have our own lives, pastimes, interests, and friends/partners.\r\n* I\u2019m not interested in indefinitely-long-distance things.\r\nWhere do you see yourself in the future?\r\n* I\u2019d like to be part of a bustling community of friends who throw parties and regularly cook for each other at each other\u2019s houses and live near each other or together. Hopefully with some casual music-making involved. Willing to move to make this happen. The model could be setting up a group house, or cooperating to live strategically close to our friends.\r\n* Somewhat related to building a community, I\u2019d probably like to start a family. A family is just a tiny, very close-knit community. (Aside: why do people always talk about wanting to start families, but never talk about wanting to finish one?)\r\n* Noticing the passage of time and my desire to start a family is what triggered making this post. I\u2019m also open to the idea of co-parenting with someone without a romantic relationship. We would need to be close friends, of course, to make it a stable partnership. I\u2019m not convinced there is a huge chasm between romance and platonic relationships, as opposed to a spectrum.\r\nWhat face do I have?\r\nThis one (next page). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI consider this to be a smile - others may say what they wish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto credit: Sally Mears\r\nWe were amused by the gate standing by itself    \r\nWhat is it like dating me?\r\nIt\u2019s hard for me to say from the inside, obviously, but some things you can expect are:\r\n* Attentiveness\r\n* Sincerity\r\n* Cuddles <3\r\n* With serious partners, I like to set aside regular time to talk about how the relationship is going, problem-solve any things that are bugging us, and brainstorm ways we can make the relationship even better than it already is. It really enhances relationships in my experience. Recommended!\r\n* Conflict management:\r\n   * I don't appreciate people with a quick temper.\r\n   * I will want to debrief until we get to the bottom of what\u2019s going on, and make sure we both feel heard.\r\n   * I\u2019m somewhat conflict-avoidant (I seem to not really have a shouty mode), but these days I think I\u2019m quite good at verbalizing when I\u2019m annoyed or angry.\r\n* They noticed my communication skills at work:  \r\nWhat are your thoughts on sex?\r\n   * For me, while I love it, sex is not an essential part of a relationship (especially when one has the possibility of multiple partners, such that something not provided by partner A can be provided by B).\r\n   * That said, I want to be desired, and might not be happy unless you seem somewhat into me physically.\r\n   * I enjoy the process of discovering what we like, and using words quite a lot to guide each other/ask for things. \r\n   * I won't say much about frequency as it varies by person, and over time.\r\n   * I'm not kinky, but to the extent that I am, I'm more subby than dommy.\r\nThings that might be dealbreakers for you\r\n   * I\u2019m quite messy. If you\u2019re neat, we might need to create Inventive Solutions like not living together, hiring a cleaner, or not dating. I pull my weight around the house where agreements are struck, but have low standards by inclination.\r\n   * I\u2019m not very physically fit. If you want a toned body, I can\u2019t provide that. I am trying to live healthily and maintain my current weight (78kg, 5\u20197\u201d) but I am not and will never be thin.\r\nValues\r\nMy most important values are:\r\n   * Actively try to make the world a better place. Take the well-being of others very seriously, and be willing to take significant personal action to that end. I\u2019ve taken the Giving What We Can pledge to donate 10% of my income to effective charities.\r\n   * Desire to believe true things and let go of cherished but false beliefs. Try to avoid over- (and under-) confidence, deliberately seek out opposing points of view, be open to strange ideas. (\u2018Good epistemics\u2019.)\r\n   * Integrity: be honest and trustworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love it if we could bond over some of these values.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other, less important values are atheism and veg(eteri)anism. These are only important to me in a partner insofar as I treat them as signs of general factors already mentioned: of taking unfamiliar ideas and others\u2019 welfare seriously. You might embody those in other ways, in which case that's fine.\r\nAesthetics\r\nClothes\r\nI wear them, but I object to dress codes. I like dungarees. I get almost all my t-shirts from boodle at this point.\r\nMusic\r\n   * Musicians who I\u2019ve seen live more than once: Louis Cole/Knower, Daisy Chute, Amanda Palmer.\r\n   * None of those are classical, but classical music (especially of the Romantic era) is the foundation of my taste since my teens, with folk and jazz and alt-pop layered on top. That comes out more in what music I play than what music I consume.\r\n   * All my Spotify likes to 13/11/21, sorted alphanumerically for your pleasure\r\nHumour\r\nSome people really get my humour; other people don\u2019t. The high variance life. But that means when people gel with my sense of humour, they really gel! I\u2019ve had multiple people say to me words to the following effect:  \r\nTODO: Get Holly\u2019s comment framed and put it in pride of place in my room\r\nSo I\u2019m going to keep on with the current humour style. My humour is silly, sometimes dry/deadpan, and quite wordplay-heavy with a good pinch of syntactic ambiguity thrown in too.\r\nFood\r\nFood is nice; I\u2019ll eat it, but it\u2019s not one of my main interests. I spend most of my time being a vegan, for animal abuse reasons, making exceptions when it doesn\u2019t seem worth the expense (e.g. I\u2019m not paying 25p for a cafe to use oat milk instead of cow\u2019s milk). You don\u2019t need to be vegan or vegetarian, as mentioned.\r\nI\u2019ve got to the end of the document. What now?\r\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, we probably have a decent chance of hitting it off, so message me! If not, feel free to share it with someone you think might be interested.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you found this page via OKCupid, it's a good idea to email me as I check that a lot more often.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re nervous about being direct and we\u2019re Facebook friends, you can use this site to indicate interest, and if it\u2019s mutual we\u2019ll both be notified. But ideally you\u2019ll bite the bullet and reach out!\r\n\r\n\r\nOr if you are less enthusiastic or just want to take a more cautious/experimental approach, maybe just invite me to more things, try to be my friend, and see if we get on in that context!\r\n\r\n\r\nCould I have written this better? Let me know!\r\nFootnotes\r\nPoly?\r\n   * Poly.\r\n   * This means that, by mutual agreement, any of my partners can date anyone.\r\n   * This doesn\u2019t mean you are expected to date anyone I happen to date. It\u2019s just me. I don\u2019t expect my friends to be friends with each other unless they want to be; this is like that.\r\n   * In practice I have one partner, who I\u2019ve been dating since late 2018.\r\n   * Here is a good poly FAQ.\r\n\u201cA shouty mode\u201d?\r\nNot knowing how to be angry by shouting was the reason I gave as a child for not wanting to become a teacher. That was pretty accurate, I was a terrible teacher, unable to control the class.",

    ProfileText: "Shaked\u2019s Dating Profile | shakeddown\nshakeddown\nSearch\nPrimary Menu\nSkip to content\nAbout\nSearch for:\nUncategorized\nShaked\u2019s Dating Profile\nSeptember 16, 2021\nshakeddown\n3 Comments\nGeneral self-description\nModerately nerdy guy (age 30) who writes stories, translates songs, and overshares cat pictures. Currently living in New York City but leaning against settling down here permanently, and likes the idea of living somewhere family-friendly (that isn\u2019t a suburb).\nDetails\nBy nerdy, I mean that I tend to get into phases where I get weirdly excited about things. To take a few random recent examples: Which countries have the best and most cost-effective transit systems[1], and urbanism and city planning\nmore generally\n[2]. Computability theory[3], or\nalternate computation models\n, like what its implications would look like for a world that had regular time travel. Acrobatics.\nThe history of clothes making[4]. Making homemade liquor.\nBuilding this took a surprisingly long time\nCats[5]. Elaborate improvised constructs.\nAlso, glacier climbing\nWhat a world would look like if time travel was possible but constrained by computability limits, except that cats could effectively get around them by having weak preferences, and the whole thing ran on a hybrid Miyazaki/Moomins/FF7 aesthetic. And so on.\nBy family-oriented, I mean, well \u2013 I like happy families. And I like kids, and really want kids, and like the kind of family/tribal structures where people of different ages actually interact.\nI am slightly trad in some ways, by which I mean something like enjoying some traditions and traditional attitudes but not actually being particularly religious. So I like Friday night family dinners (with the candles and the nice tablecloth[6]), and I like casual gender norms (In that, say, I prefer the sound of \u201cmy wife\u201d to \u201cmy spouse\u201d), but don\u2019t do regular prayers or really keep kosher (except I don\u2019t eat pork).\nFor stories \u2013 I wrote\nthis one about first contact\n, or\nthis one about bike lanes\n. For song translations, I mostly do Israeli folk songs (like\nthis one\n, or\nthis one\n).\nLife/Relationship Goals\nMost of all, I want a family. I want a good happy partnership relationship, and I want a bunch of kids. There\u2019s probably practical constraints on how many kids I could practically have or handle, but in principle, I\u2019m a fan of the idea of having lots of kids. I think I would be a good dad.\nI currently live in New York and work doing vague finance and programming stuff. I like it here for now, but I wouldn\u2019t want to settle down permanently, or raise kids here. Where I want to end up is a hard question \u2013 for having kids, I\u2019d want to be somewhere clean and pedestrian-friendly, where the kids can walk safely by themselves to get around or play outside or whatnot. Sometimes I think about going back to Israel, but there are other places that meet those conditions. (Financially, I do have more than enough to support a family, including if I was married to someone who wanted to be a homemaker or work nonprofit or whatever, or to take a few years off for that matter).\nMy ideal relationship involves sharing random ideas that get us excited off each other, cooking or going on hikes together, randomly messaging each other cat pictures, developing a pool of shared references and frames that becomes a little like a shared language, spiderman kisses (that is, where one or both of the people doing the kissing are hanging upside-down), and eventually raising a bunch of kids together.\nAlso, occasional backpacking trips where we wind up cooking improvised pancakes in random abandoned cabins.\nYou\n?\n[7]\nIf the above part sounds appealing, you should try to contact me! You can email me (\nshaked.koplewitz@gmail.com\n, preferred), find me on facebook, whatever.\nSee? Very welcoming\nI like the idea of social proof \u2013 if we know people in common, you can talk to me through them, or talk to them about whether they think we\u2019d work.\nProperties common in people I have good relationships with:\nGetting delighted by things. Probably the biggest single factor, although it can be hard to describe. If you\u2019re the sort of person who would build the food pyramid I mentioned above, or give names to random wildlife, or stop to look in random windows because you\u2019re curious what the people inside live like, or like to think about the logistics of feeding a continent of sentient hamsters, we are likely to get along and you should give me a call.\nCompatible life goals.

    ProfileText: "\ufeffHello! My name is Kathy Garcia and I am looking for a primary partner and co-parent. I don't yet have children but very much want to in the near future. \r\n\r\nIt is not required (though definitely an option) that this person also biologically father these children. For legal convenience related to co-parenting I do probably want us to be legally married, but I'd want our relationship to be open/polyamorous.\r\n\r\nI want this person to be my primary collaborator on the project of being a human in the world, as well as the project of child-rearing. I want to be open about everything with them and have them do the same with me, and help each other to solve our problems, large and small. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am open to any gender, race, body type, etc.\r\nAbout me\r\nBasics  \r\n31 years old, 5'8\", 130-150 lb. Ethnic background is 25% Mexican, 75% mixed Western European.\r\n\r\nAFAB, genderfluid, they/them, pansexual, polyamorous, demisexual, autistic, ADHD, secular, rationalist, submissive. Happy to talk more about what any of these mean to me.\r\n\r\nI am based in Oakland, CA and would like to stay here for at least another year or two but don't feel tied to it in the long term. \r\n\r\nI graduated from Caltech in 2015 with a B.S. in Computation and Neural Systems. After that I bounced around a few healthcare-related startups, then spent 6 years at Benchling building software for biotech, pharma, and academic biology labs, and am now a Platform Software Engineer at METR.\r\n\r\nProfiles: OkCupid, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, GitHub\r\nPros\r\n\r\n\r\n* Kindness/Compassion. I care very deeply about people, both as a class and as individuals. If we have a long-term relationship I will come to care very deeply about you.\r\n* Loyalty. I will be fiercely dedicated to making our relationship work and to any agreements we make as part of our relationship contract.\r\n* Openness to Experience. One of my friends once said that of everyone he knew, I was the one who would most literally \"try anything once\". I really love novelty and will probably be down to try anything with you that you'd like to get me into. This includes sex and kink, but also hobbies and other activities.\r\n* General intelligence. Hard evidence for this: I graduated from Caltech and have been successful in my career as a Software Engineer. I have also had my IQ tested a couple of times and scored about 140.\r\n* Practical Skills. I have a variety of these, which seems relatively rare in the communities I find myself in. I can also pick up new ones fairly quickly. I am not an expert in any of them but good enough to do a respectable job. Here are a few of them:\r\n   * Cooking\r\n   * Sewing\r\n   * Soldering\r\n   * Furniture assembly\r\n   * Home maintenance/repair\r\n   * First Aid and basic medicine\r\n* Financial stability. I am an early member of a successful tech startup. I am trying to avoid lifestyle creep, but I generally expect that I and my immediate family will be materially comfortable for a long time. If you also have significant income I will expect you to contribute some to the child-rearing project, but I'm open to partners who are low-income as well. \r\n* Knowledgeable about child-rearing. I have known my entire life that I wanted to be a parent and have read quite a bit about how to care for babies and children. That being said, I have minimal practical childcare experience.\r\n* Comfortable with scary, gross, or dark things. I can deal with insects, spiders, traumatic injury, bodily fluids, most emergency situations, and death in a calm, clinical, and effective manner. There are also very few topics that are taboo to talk about. It would be great if this was also true of you.\r\n* Good relationship with my parents. This is some evidence of my ability to maintain relationships long-term. (EDIT: My mother has passed away since time of writing. I still have a good relationship with my father and his new wife!)\r\n* Cute and cuddly. I think I'm decently conventionally attractive, but what I really mean here is that I enjoy leaning into cutesiness, especially in tone of voice and turns of phrase. Partners tend to find me adorable, though of course there's huge selection bias there. I also love cuddling.\r\n* Paperwork. I actually like doing paperwork and will be happy to manage yours and any that arises for the children.\r\n* Style. Someone once told me that I have \"an irreverent style that is highly marketable.\" It was the strangest compliment I've ever received but I don't think it's inaccurate. People often seem delighted by my sense of humor and turns of phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\nCons\r\n* Chronic pain. I have occipital neuralgia, which causes a really distracting form of pain in my head, neck, and shoulders. I also have some lower back pain. It's rarely debilitating, but there are times I need to stop doing a physical activity before it's done, and there are times I need to just lie in bed for a few hours. I am in the process of getting treatment for this and have some hope that it will not be a problem in the long term, but this is far from guaranteed.\r\n* Mild emotional instability. I will sometimes get very upset and want you to spend time and effort and attention on comforting me. It's not that I take actions I don't endorse or that I turn into \"someone else\" in these states, just, if you're not comfortable with comforting me when I cry we probably aren't a good match. \r\n* Executive dysfunction/akrasia. I go through phases where it becomes very difficult for me to get anything done. This responds very well to social pressure though, so if you just tell me \"hey go do the thing\" I will probably go do it. In fact, if you're willing to do a lot of this for me that would be especially great.\r\n* Mild addictive personality. Every once in a while I find something that really gives me dopamine and get too into it. So far none of these addictions have had major impact on my life and all have resolved on their own after a while, and I am careful to keep it that way. But it's likely I'll continue to have phases where I spend all of my free time and perhaps a bit too much money on one specific activity, and occasionally overindulge on food or alcohol. I actually am pretty okay with this and would not want you to stop me unless it was having a negative impact on you, me or the children.\r\n* Abandonment issues. I am pretty afraid and insecure about the idea that someone will leave me in a time of need. I will likely need regular reassurance that you still like me and are committed to our relationship. If you have an avoidant attachment style or are not comfortable reassuring me, we likely are not a good match.\r\n* Other mental health issues. I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD, and autism. I take Adderall 5 days a week. In particular - until some time in 2014 I considered myself very mentally healthy and happy. Then I went through a rough breakup, graduated college and was thrust into adulthood, Trump got elected, and my internal experience got worse and worse. I am past the peak of this now and am optimistic about future improvement, but it seems likely that I'll have at least some phases of high anxiety and/or depression for the rest of my life. \r\n* Messiness. I am fairly messy and disorganized. I'm willing to work on this but it seems unlikely it'll ever stop being a problem, since it's been true my whole life and is likely related to my ADHD. If this bothers you a lot we probably aren't a good fit. If you're willing to clean up for me that would be amazing. In the future when I settle down, I will probably just hire someone(s) to clean up after me.\r\n* Lack of physical fitness. I'm not very strong and don't have very much stamina. I can get shit done when necessary but will likely need help lifting very heavy objects and might decline things like long hikes or strenuous sexual positions.  I am willing to work on this and would love it if you motivated me to get regular exercise.\r\n* Bad at scheduling and punctuality. If we set a date there's a high likelihood that I'll be 5-15 minutes late, and a nontrivial likelihood that I'll forget about it entirely. Again this is something I'm willing to work on but also have been trying to improve my whole life and seen only minimal progress. If something is *really* important, I do generally manage to make it, though.\r\n* Body hair. My body hair is thick and dark. I have had laser hair removal on my legs which thinned it out but did not get rid of enough of it for my legs to not look hairy. I don't remove any of it regularly and I don't think I'll start, because I don't have bandwidth for another regular hygiene activity, so if this bothers you we probably aren't a good match.\r\n* Sexual hangups. This one needs to be broken down into a few bullet points:\r\n   * Demisexuality. I'm demisexual, which to me means that I never feel attracted to anyone I don't know, but when I know someone and relate to them well I almost always feel some attraction to them. It will probably be a while before I feel that way about you.\r\n   * Low sex drive. In general even once I do feel attraction I still have a pretty low sex drive most of the time. When I'm not actively in a relationship I can go many months without sex and it does not bother me at all. All of my past long-term relationships have fallen into the following pattern: At the beginning of the relationship, I'm excited about having sex multiple times a day and we do. Once the NRE (new relationship energy) wears off I'm a lot less interested in sex and my partner starts pressuring me about it. The pressure makes me want it even less and we enter a vicious cycle. I am not sure whether the cycle is started by me losing interest or by them beginning to pressure me.\r\n   * Pain during sex. I'm pretty sure my genitals are more sensitive to pain than average. It's easy for someone to accidentally cause pain while trying to cause pleasure. I'm not sure if this has medical cause, I've been examined a few times and been told there's nothing obviously wrong.\r\n   * Anxiety around giving feedback. I've had a lot of experiences where I tried giving feedback (including that someone was hurting me) and had my partner not care, not be able to figure out how to do better, or turn the interaction into me doing emotional labor for them because they felt bad about not being good enough. This has trained my brain that giving feedback will be useless or worse, and so I often just don't, including gritting my teeth through painful sex that I'm not enjoying. I will likely need a lot of encouragement and understanding around this, at least at first.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeutrals\r\n\r\n\r\n* Very Direct. Probably most neurotypical people perceive me as too blunt. I don't enjoy having to pepper in niceties in order to get my point across, and will only do it when I have bandwidth to spare. Of course other people find this refreshing.\r\n* Extroverted. I process things through socializing, and go to medium-to-large social events often. I would love it if you accompanied me to these events, and if you don't want to go to them at all ever, we may not be a good match.\r\n* Strong preference for Tell Culture. 80% of the time, you will have a better model of your own thoughts and preferences than I do, and I will have a better model of mine. Therefore I don't want to spend a lot of effort on guessing what you want or what's going through your head. That being said, there is the other 20% of the time, and it certainly is very nice when people are able to make correct guesses. I'm definitely interested in forming good models of my partners and sometimes surprising them with things they didn't know they wanted. But I don't want that to be the primary dynamic of the relationship.\r\n* Pets. I like cats a lot and am okay with small dogs. Large dogs scare me a bit and I would not want to live with one. I'm probably neutral-to-positive on most other pets.\r\n* Hobbies. Here are some of mine, it would be cool if you share some of them and we can do them together.\r\n   * Board games\r\n   * Puzzle hunts\r\n   * Crossword puzzles\r\n   * Makeup and Skincare\r\n   * Alternative Fashion\r\n   * Alternative Music (especially pop punk and power metal)\r\n   * Cosplay\r\n   * Star Trek (DS9 > TNG > VOY > SNW > PIC > PRO > DIS > ENT. Have not seen much of TOS, TAS, or Lower Decks. The Kelvin Timeline movies are terrible.)\r\n   * Travel\r\n   * Burner culture (as in Burning Man)\r\n   * Counterculture in general\r\n* Very Online. I spend almost all of my time on the Internet and am never without my phone. I'm deep into meme culture, especially on TikTok. \r\n* Army Brat. My father was in the Army when I was growing up and we moved every few years. I have moved a total of 14 times in my life, not counting moving between rooms in college. I have lived all over the country as well as in Germany for 5 years. I speak German - I was once fluent but am now a little rusty.\r\n* Gender. Around 80% of the time I am not thinking about gender and trying to apply it to myself feels jarring, so I don't think I have one. Around 15% of the time, especially during penetrative sex, I feel quite feminine. The remaining 5% of the time I feel fairly masculine. I don't expect to be treated differently in these modes, but I do want to be referred to with they/them pronouns. That being said, I am happy with my AFAB body and don't plan to use hormones or gender affirming surgery to alter it.\r\n* Submissive and Kinky. I respond very well to someone else taking the lead or giving instructions in bed and I enjoy many forms of sensation play, bondage, impact play, and pain play. I don't consider myself a masochist as I don't get pleasure from pain in and of itself, but as a sign of submission or exploration of my limits it can be very fun. I am up for kinky play much more often than I am up for genital-focused sex.\r\nChild-rearing plans\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to have at least one biological child (maybe two, but I want to wait and see how I feel about having a second after I have one. I am also open to the idea of adopting the second one.) I want to carry and birth this child myself, ideally via vaginal birth. I see this as one of the big fundamental human experiences and would like to have it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to biologically father the child, you of course need to produce viable sperm, but I will also want both of us to submit to genetic counseling. You need to not carry the genes for any serious genetic disorders nor have family history of any serious heritable conditions. I am not sure yet if I'd also want to do embryo selection, and this may depend on our genetic compatibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to biologically father the child, I will likely get sperm from a sperm bank, and you can have some input on what qualities we are looking for in a donor. I'm also open to conceiving a child via sex with a friend or other partner who is interested in being the biological father, but I don't have any candidates right now.\r\n\r\nMy actual ideal situation for child-rearing would be living with a group of like-minded people who are all communally raising children, and who may be in a connected polycule. But finding such an arrangement and keeping it stable is difficult, so I am open to other arrangements (including something fairly close to the \"nuclear family\", although I would still hope to keep more outside connections and partners than is typical in that situation).\r\n\r\nIt is important to me that the two of us share the parenting labor fairly equitably, and that you involve yourself in the child's life. I am not sure what I want to do about childcare if we both work - I may take a sabbatical, or we may hire a nanny. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn parenting, my top priority will be the child's current and future subjective well-being, as opposed to their intelligence, earning potential, impact, or any other specific outcome. Of course there will be times when I guide them toward those things as well, but it will never take priority over trying to raise a happy, healthy individual. It is important to me that you do the same. \r\n\r\n\r\nPeople keep telling me that I should include something about my schooling preferences here, but I am open to a variety of options, as long as they seem like they will serve the children well. I probably lean toward private schooling or homeschooling, and would be against religious schooling.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't want to gender the children until they tell us what gender they identify as, and it is important to me that you are willing to do this as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nDealbreakers\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to those implied above, here are a few more things that would be dealbreakers for me:\r\n\r\n\r\n* You don't have solid conflict resolution skills, and arguments will continually end poorly.\r\n* Your politics are right-wing in the sense of privileging markets or other existing social orders over human flourishing, autonomy, and well-being.\r\n* Your opinions, political and otherwise, do not change based on evidence.\r\n* You do not treat me as an equal.\r\n* You are not ready, willing, and able to spend a significant amount of time, effort, and attention on our relationship and on child-rearing.\r\n* You lie often.\r\n* There are many common tasks and situations that you can't handle without help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you got through all of this and think you might be interested in a connection, please contact me at yandereko@gmail.com. I look forward to talking to you!",

    ProfileText: "My dating profile\nHome\n\u2022\nWritings\nMy dating profile\nBy Brian Tomasik\nFirst published:\n2020 Sep 20\n. Last nontrivial update:\n2023 Aug 24\n.\nUpdate\nAs of fall 2023, after having this profile up for nearly three years, I think I probably don't want a relationship after all, though maybe this will change again some day. :)\nThe main issue is that relationships take up a fair amount of time, often more than you expect they will. I already feel stressed by the number of tasks I have to do and the finite energy I have for completing them. A relationship adds more items to my todo list, and even though most of the time spent on a relationship is fun, it's an additional firehose of responsibility that I can't just turn off when I'm too busy. Solo hobbies are better in this regard because I can do as much or as little of them as I choose at any given time.\nI never want to have children or pets because I don't want the responsibility of being the primary caretaker for another creature. Likewise, I plausibly don't want the responsibility of being the primary caretaker for another adult human. I like helping people from time to time, but being the main source of companionship and emotional support for another person can begin to feel burdensome\u2014unless that other person is extremely introverted and self-sufficient.\nI'm keeping this page up as an archive. Feel welcome to still write to me if you want to, such as because you think you might be an excellent match or because you think a long-term relationship could require minimal time in most future scenarios. (I'm not really interested in short-term relationships.)\nBelow is the original dating profile.\n\u2744\n\u2744\n\u2744\nThis is a dating profile for myself. It's written partly out of academic interest, as an autobiographical portrait of my current life, and partly with the goal of possibly finding a life partner. I have so many preferences about my lifestyle that the number of people for whom I would be a suitable romantic partner is extremely small. Nonetheless, if you happen to find what I wrote appealing, feel free to\ncontact me\nabout this topic. (If you're shy about revealing your identity, you could write to me using a pseudonymous email account.)\nSummary\nText fields on dating websites for describing oneself and one's relationship preferences are almost always too short. This page allows me to expand on what I'm looking for if I pursue a romantic relationship.\nI'm open to either an in-person or indefinite long-distance relationship. In theory I would prefer an in-person relationship, but I'm very picky about my lifestyle, so in practice an indefinite long-distance relationship may be more feasible.\nWhether the relationship is in-person or long-distance, here are some criteria to help quickly figure out if we might be compatible. I would look for\na woman (cisgender) (straight or bisexual or other orientations are fine)\nlocated anywhere in the world\nwithin roughly ~10 years of my own age (as of 2022, I'm 35 years old)\n(ideally, though not a hard requirement) either vegan or the only animal products consumed on a regular basis are dairy and beef\ninterested in animal welfare, reducing suffering, s-risks, effective altruism, philosophy, science/technology, and/or related topics\na long-term relationship, ideally one that might last forever (although given that divorce rates are high, there's a good chance it wouldn't last forever)\nlow time commitment (spending only 2-4 hours per week together in the long run on average; it would be higher during some weeks and lower in other weeks). (In the case of an in-person relationship, we might be physically in the same room for slightly more than 2-4 hours per week due to needing to coordinate practical things, put away groceries, or do other tasks together around the house. That said, I prefer to do most household chores by myself to avoid being distracted.)\nIn the case of an in-person relationship, these are some additional things I would look for:\nno kids ever (unless they don't live with us)\n(ideally, though not a hard requirement) no pets\nno smoking or illegal drugs\nbeing mindful not to accidentally crush bugs around the house, and euthanizing any bugs that we do kill\nnot doing outdoor activities together\nnot traveling together\nrarely going to events/parties together\nminimal noise and minimal interruptions\nI prefer to stay at my current house, so an in-person relationship would involve the other person being willing to eventually move to a rural part of New York State. (It would be fine if it took 5-10 years or more before we could live together.)\nIn an indefinite long-distance relationship, it's fine if you already have kids and don't want more (or at least don't want more kids fathered by me). I just wouldn't want the noise and complexity of having kids in my own house.\nI'm open to either monogamy or polyamory depending on the circumstances. I would probably prefer monogamy in an ideal world, but in practice, polyamory might be more realistic given that I don't want to spend a lot of time on a relationship.\nBecause I'm introverted and have so many uncommon lifestyle preferences, I don't mind if I remain single forever. Sometimes I think I might even prefer staying single.\nTo see my answers on other compatibility questions, visit\nmy OkCupid profile\n.\nContents\nUpdate\nSummary\nWhy a detailed dating profile?\nLong-distance vs in-person relationships\nMy quirks\nMy lifestyle\nValues\nOther compatibility topics\nAppearance\nPersonality\nBeing sugar-hungry and sugar-full\nMonogamy vs polyamory\nPolyamory for myself\nPolyamory for my partner\nAcknowledgements\nWhy a detailed dating profile?\nThere seem to be two main philosophies when it comes to dating. Some people, including me, prefer to enumerate their preferences and dealbreakers from the outset, in order to filter out incompatible people as quickly as possible. Others apparently like to \"keep an air of mystery\" in the process and get to know details about someone over the course of in-person conversations. I can understand this latter approach if you enjoy dating just for its own sake. Maybe it's similar to how I want to be surprised by the ending of a movie rather than having it spoiled. However, if your goal is to actually find a great match, it seems to me that laying out as much detail up front as possible is the better way to go. I would rather be in a nice relationship than be looking for one, so I prefer to find a good match more efficiently.\nIn that spirit, this page lays out the main compatibility issues I would have when considering a romantic relationship. I have\na lot\nof dealbreakers. I would rather be single than be in a relationship with 99.9% of potential matches, so filtering on compatibility ahead of time is pretty essential for me.\nLong-distance vs in-person relationships\nI live in a house in a rural area of upstate New York, USA. For reasons of convenience and family, I prefer not to move away from where I am now, at least not for another decade or two. However, there aren't many people near me, I don't have a car or driver's license, and I prefer not to make unnecessary car trips because this squishes and splats bugs (and I don't want to cause bugs to suffer). So for the short run, any relationship I have would almost certainly be mostly long-distance. I\ndislike traveling\n, but I could probably stand to meet up in person about once a year if the person were far away (including international), or maybe twice a year if the person lived in the northeastern USA. For me, an ideal approach to long-distance communication in the long run might be, say, a 2-hour video or voice call once a week (or maybe a 4-hour call every other week), plus short written messages roughly daily or every other day. (In the first few months of the relationship, we might be excited and want to talk a lot more than this.)\nSometimes, if I'm in a productive mood or am otherwise not interested in socializing, I like to avoid checking my messages for several days in a row. If I'm ready to get useful things done, I don't want to waste time on talking, and I worry that even a small amount of talking might break my focus and lead me to want to talk more. This is similar to the reason why I avoid eating even a single bite of food when I'm not hungry: if I eat even a small amount, it may shift my body into eating mode, causing me to become hungry. I imagine that this tendency to not check my messages as often as most people do would be pretty annoying for many partners. There's an OkCupid question: \"Is it a requirement that you communicate every day with your significant other (via phone, text, in person, whatever)?\" I find that many women say it is a requirement, but that would be close to a dealbreaker for me.\nIf the relationship lasted a while and the other person was open to moving to my somewhat ugly rural house, I would consider that option as well. However, living together raises numerous additional complications, such as minimizing noise, avoiding interrupting each other too often, and resolving conflicting preferences about the house itself. These complications might be worth it for the benefits of being together in person, including more physical contact and ease/privacy of communication.\nMy quirks\nI have a number of unusual lifestyle quirks and preferences that may cause incompatibilities. Here are some main ones:\nMy waking hours are irregular and hard to predict. One day I might be awake during daylight hours, and a few days later, I might be awake during the night. One reason for this is that my sleep sometimes gets disrupted, meaning that I sleep too little and then need to nap the next day, leading to further sleep disturbance. The other reason is that even when my sleep pattern is pretty regular from one day to the next, my waking hours may tend to creep forward by roughly an hour per day, which is made possible because I don't use an alarm clock. My sleep schedule is able to move around like this because I don't have any set working hours and keep pre-scheduled phone calls to a minimum. As a result of this irregularity, the times when I would be available to talk with a romantic partner would be variable and unpredictable.\nI can be a bit irrationally cautious about some things. For example, I'm a bit of a germaphobe. I don't like sharing towels, silverware, dishes, etc. I dislike \"double dipping\" with food. I'm nervous about getting Lyme disease from ticks that are prevalent around my house, and I spend a fair amount of time checking my body for ticks. If someone else goes outside around my house, I prefer to avoid touching them until after a thorough tick check in case they have ticks crawling on them.\nConsistent with my germaphobia, I'm\nvery cautious\nregarding sexually transmitted infections (STIs). I'm even slightly grossed out by lip kissing and would prefer kissing places that aren't bodily openings. Before having sex I would first want to do a complete array of STI tests, including for things like genital herpes that aren't always tested by default. Because of the \"window period\" for HIV testing, I would prefer for an HIV test to occur as much as half a year after the last possible HIV exposure (such as from sex with a previous partner), and I would prefer to avoid sex (even with condoms) until the test came back negative. While I think having sex before marriage is a good idea to verify sexual compatibility, I prefer not to rush into it either. Given that most people are vastly less cautious about STIs than this, I'm probably fairly irrational here, but oh well.\nI'm troubled by the\nsuffering of bugs\naround the house, and I try to euthanize injured or dying bugs, typically by putting them into a container in the freezer. While I wouldn't expect a romantic partner to actively care for bugs in this way, I would be emotionally upset by deliberate swatting, crushing, drowning, etc of bugs. In addition, I prefer to seal food scraps in a plastic container before throwing them in the trash to prevent fruit flies from breeding. I oppose composting food waste because it gives rise to thousands of bugs whose short lives inevitably end in painful deaths.\nIn many parts of the world, particularly towns and cities, the residential water supply is drawn from rivers, lakes, or reservoirs that contain numerous invertebrate animals, like copepods and rotifers. These animals die painfully as that water is withdrawn for treatment. At my current house, water is drawn instead from a deep well, which likely contains vastly less biological activity than surface waters do. If I were to move from my current house to a city, I would feel guilty about showering and washing my hands because of the numerous invertebrates it would kill.\nMy lifestyle\nYou can see some biographical information about me on\nmy home page\nand\nmy r\u00e9sum\u00e9\n.\nI worked at Microsoft from 2009 to 2013. I donated some of my earnings to charity but kept a lot as personal savings. At the age of 26, I \"retired\" from formal employment and instead devoted more time to blogging on my site\nEssays on Reducing Suffering\n. I'm also an advisor to some nonprofit organizations, as well as to individuals who ask me questions. I'm a well known member of the \"effective altruism\" movement. I do all of these activities unpaid, so technically I'm unemployed.\nI'm extremely introverted and can go for days without needing to talk with other people. I prefer to work on whatever I'm interested in at the moment for long stretches of uninterrupted time. Typically I do \"social\" activities like checking email and Facebook once or twice a day, usually when eating meals at my computer. I almost never leave my house, not even to go outdoors, because I don't want to crush bugs by walking outside, and there may be ticks in the grass. Plus, almost everything I want to do is indoors. (I take vitamin D supplements due to not getting much sunshine.) I spend most of my waking hours at my computer; the rest is spent lifting dumbbells, preparing food, showering, cleaning things around the house, and so on. I work at my computer standing up on a treadmill, and for 1-3 hours per day I walk slowly on the treadmill while using my computer.\nI prefer to organize items in my room the way I want them organized, and I wouldn't want other people to live in my room. Even if I shared the house with a romantic partner, I would sleep in a separate bed in a separate room to avoid being woken up by the other person and to avoid waking the other person. Plus, given my erratic waking hours, I often would not be sleeping at the same time as the other person anyway.\nIf I were to have a romantic relationship, I would prefer for my lifestyle to remain roughly the same as it is now. That's pretty feasible in the case of a long-distance relationship because it doesn't involve living with another person. For an in-person relationship, I would hope that our living situation could be pretty similar to the way that two strangers would share a house, in terms of sleeping apart, having separate rooms, and minimizing interruptions of each other. Of course, we wouldn't be just like strangers because we would also meet up to talk regularly, maybe do some chores together, and share physical intimacy.\nIt's probably not feasible for now, but in the long run I could imagine even living in little separate houses next door to one another rather than in the same house, in order to reduce disturbing one another and make a clear separation between our respective spaces. This arrangement would minimize the disagreements and annoyances that living together could cause while allowing for closer contact than is possible with a long-distance relationship. Ideally these two mini houses could be connected by an indoor hallway so that we wouldn't have to go outdoors in order to visit each other.\nI would prefer a relationship in which we work on our own separate projects almost all the time and don't judge each other for how we spend our time. I would enjoy talking about what we're doing but without any expectations for the other person. For this reason, I don't have strong preferences about whether the other person would have a job or not, would be \"ambitious\" or not, etc.\nI would prefer for my partner to be reasonably independent and not need my help too often, though I would be happy to occasionally assist with physical tasks, questions, emotional troubles, and so on. Likewise, I also would be pretty independent.\nMy costs of living are fairly low. Most of my expenses are on essentials like food and health insurance. If my partner wanted financial support from me, I would prefer if she were also fairly frugal, although spending on the order of $1000 to $2000 per year on \"luxuries\" would be ok. If my partner earned her own income and spent that money on a more lavish lifestyle, that may also be ok, although I'm more likely to get along with people who have an altruistic mindset and want to donate significant portions of their income to charity.\nValues\nMy main altruistic focus in life is seeking to reduce suffering, especially the suffering of non-human animals and possible digital creatures that may be created in the future. In philosophical jargon, I'm roughly a\nnegative utilitarian\n, which means I think suffering is vastly more morally significant than happiness or other valuable things. Unbearable torture cannot be \"morally offset\" by also bringing enough pleasure into the world. This stance leads to a kind of\nantinatalism\n, because often the easiest way to prevent unbearable suffering is for a being never to be born in the first place. For example, there's an extraordinary amount of animal (especially invertebrate) suffering occurring in nature, due to predation, disease, starvation, and so on. One way to reduce this suffering is to reduce the amount of nature that exists. For instance, we could cover lawns with gravel to prevent grass growth, and with less grass to eat, there would be fewer animals. (In the long run, I would like to have a gravel, no-grass lawn at my house. It should also reduce the risk of ticks.)\nPolitically my values lean toward progressive, but I think there are many real-world complexities that make any dogmatic stances unwise. For example, increasing the minimum wage seems noble but could also increase unemployment and force some companies out of business (though it may still be a good policy on balance). Also, my negative-utilitarian philosophy is sometimes at odds with progressive policies, such as when I favor reducing rather than increasing the amount of wilderness that exists. On issues like feminism, I'm somewhere in between the vociferous voices on either side of the debates. Despite agreeing with social-justice advocates on many policy stances, I can be turned off by the more aggressive forms of social-justice activism because I prefer more respectful and nuanced discussion of these difficult issues.\nI'm an atheist, although I find it reasonably likely that we (or at least some copies of us) live in a computer simulation of some kind.\nIn terms of interpersonal relationships, I think trust is fundamental. Knowing that the other person won't do something harmful behind your back is very important. A relationship should be a place where you feel completely comfortable in the other person's presence and can tell him/her anything, as long as it's done in a respectful way. For example, if one person were inclined to cheat on his/her partner, I would favor discussing these feelings openly and seeing what could be done about the situation. If one person feels dissatisfied about some aspect of the relationship, it's generally better to discuss the problem and work toward solutions rather than letting the negative feelings fester. (That said, if unhappy feelings are trivial or transitory, sometimes it makes sense to keep them to yourself and let them fade on their own rather than troubling the other person about them.)\nOther compatibility topics\nI intend to remain childfree indefinitely, because raising kids takes an enormous amount of time that I would rather spend on my current activities. I have a vasectomy, which combined with possibly other forms of birth control such as condoms and the rhythm method would preclude pregnancies. I would also want to avoid adopting kids. I dislike pets for a similar reason: they take time and resources, they can get into trouble around the house, and I don't get much enjoyment from being around them. Plus, I don't want to buy pet food containing animal products, which gives some revenue to the factory-farming industry. My childfree requirement is an absolute dealbreaker, while my anti-pet stance is merely a strong preference. If there were an otherwise amazing match who really wanted a cat or dog, I could probably learn to live with that.\nI'm a lacto-vegetarian, meaning I'm vegan except that I eat dairy products (mostly cheese and ice cream). I'd be happy with a partner who was vegan or lacto-vegetarian. I also don't mind someone who eats beef on a regular basis because the harm caused to farmed animals per calorie of food is much smaller than for other forms of meat and because in some cases I think cattle farming may reduce wild-animal suffering. I would probably feel dismayed to see a partner eat any smaller animals than cows on a regular basis. (Maybe lamb would be ok too.) Eating a serving of fish or other non-cow animals once or twice per year as a health precaution would probably be ok, and eating meat leftovers from a social event that would otherwise go to waste is of course fine.\nI would also prefer if my partner didn't consume much honey or\nrice\n, for animal-suffering reasons, although this is less important than not eating chicken/fish/eggs, and if I can be convinced that rice harvesting is no more violent than, e.g., wheat harvesting, I'd be fine with it.\nI prefer to avoid non-trivially illegal activities, including illegal drugs. I also wouldn't want secondhand smoke in the house. My main concerns with drugs like alcohol would be whether they impair one's judgment or cause one's personality to become more annoying. Personally I don't do any drugs (besides medical/nutritional ones) and never consume alcohol. I even avoid caffeine, but I wouldn't care if a partner consumed it.\nI'm looking for a long-term relationship, one in which I could be best friends with my partner for an indefinite period of time. Such a relationship could potentially last for life, but I also recognize that statistically, even many marriages don't last, and maybe this is a good thing, because people can change a lot over time.\nIf we lived together, I would imagine splitting housework in the same way that strangers sharing a house would: we would generally each take care of our own side of it. We could each clean our own rooms, prepare our own meals, do our own laundry, etc. If one person wanted to do some of these things for the other person, that would be fine (although I personally would still want to clean my own rooms and prepare most of my own food). Some activities like grocery shopping and taking trash to the transfer station would make more sense for a single person to do for both of us (or we could hire a third party to do these tasks).\nI would favor dividing the house between us as much as possible and letting each person do whatever s/he wants with his/her half of the house (except in the case of externalities like noise, secondhand smoke, jeopardizing the security of our home computer network, etc). Our possessions would likewise be mostly our own rather than shared. Dividing things up in this way would reduce the frequency of disagreements about how something should be done, because there would be fewer things to disagree about. Some rooms (like the kitchen) and possessions (like the washing machine) would have to be shared, and in that case, we would decide together what changes to make to them.\nI think entertainment/music/etc tastes are pretty irrelevant for romantic compatibility. For whatever it's worth, the movies/shows/channels on Netflix and YouTube that I watch are mostly comedies, because I usually want to relax rather than to process something emotionally heavy, though I enjoy other genres too on occasion. Even if I lived with someone else, I would prefer to watch TV on my own while exercising, because I only want to watch something when I'm specifically in the mood for it rather than at a scheduled time, and I often take breaks. For example, if I'm lifting dumbbells, I may need to take a bathroom break to wash my hands if they've become greasy, which worsens my grip. I would prefer for a partner to always use earbuds/headphones while watching TV or listening to music to avoid creating noise, and I do the same.\nAppearance\nI think I generally look ok, but there are some parts of my appearance that may not be very pleasant:\nI have a lot of acne on my upper chest and back.\nWhen I don't shower often enough, I develop flaky skin on my face and scalp due to seborrhoeic dermatitis. After I wash my face with Head & Shoulders shampoo, the areas where skin was peeled off can appear red.\nI'm somewhat overweight, with most of the excess fat concentrated in my belly. I'm 69.5 inches tall with a weight around 183 pounds, making my BMI in the range 26 to 27.\nI shave all the hair on my body fairly short, to roughly half a centimeter in length. Having less hair just feels less messy, and it makes checking my body for ticks easier. I fully shave my facial hair about once a week and let it grown in between those shavings.\nFollowing are some fairly typical photos of me, taken in summer 2020.\nIn the last of these photos you can most clearly see some dermatitis buildup on my face.\nFor better or worse, the physical features that I find attractive in women are roughly society's conventional beauty standards, perhaps because that's what I grew up seeing on TV and in magazines in my childhood during the 1990s. I think attractiveness affects male motivation for a relationship at a deep \"lizard brain\" level, so it does matter to some degree, but I also prefer if a partner doesn't feel pressure to change her appearance on account of me, because that can be unpleasant.\nThe main reason attractiveness matters is not for sex; I don't care\nthat\nmuch about sex per se. The more significant reason is that attractiveness plays some role in the amount of \"warm fuzzies\" that I feel and how much I enjoy talking with the person, and for me, those are the main reasons to have a romantic relationship. I have relatively little relationship experience, so maybe this view of mine is naive or would change with time.\nIn general, my (possibly naive) ranked list of motivations for a relationship in descending order of importance is\nThe feeling of warm fuzzies when spending time together (talking, doing chores together, etc). These fuzzies are also somewhat present when we're apart and doing our own stuff.\nCompanionship, friendship, emotional support, mental intimacy.\nPhysical intimacy (hugging, cuddling, sexual activity).\nHelping each other out with chores/etc.\nThe last of these two mainly only apply to an in-person relationship rather than a long-distance one, but they're less important to me than the first two.\nUpdate from 2022: I hope readers don't conclude from the above discussion that they have to be reasonably attractive in order to contact me. I care less about attractiveness than the average man, even if I may be more honest about its role than most men are. Since originally writing the above section in 2020, I've found that the amount I care about attractiveness has decreased even further over time. Traits like warmth, emotional stability, intelligence, caring about animal welfare and reducing suffering, and being able to get tasks done in a dependable way on one's own are all probably at least as important to me as physical attractiveness\u2014except if a potential partner is unusually unattractive. Roughly, I think as long as a potential partner is above the ~25th percentile of attractiveness for her age, then I could probably learn to live with that, especially if she would be open to sometimes using porn together during sexual activity for extra eye candy, which I expect could go a long way toward reducing how much I care about her own appearance.\nWhen I was a kid, I was often told that \"beauty is only skin deep\" and \"what really matters is on the inside\" when choosing a romantic partner. I generally assumed that was the case, but over time I began hearing more people express a contrary opinion that no, actually, physical attractiveness plays a big role in relationship satisfaction. I assumed that maybe those people were right and that maybe the messages about how beauty doesn't matter too much were sort of benign propaganda. However, as I've continued dating and introspecting on what matters to me, I'm beginning to think that maybe the people who said appearances aren't that important were mostly right? I still don't have a lot of experience, so maybe I'll change my mind yet again. If porn and masturbation didn't exist or were prohibited by my religion, then I could imagine that the attractiveness of my partner might be fairly important, because I would only be able to have sexual experiences with that one person. But given that porn and masturbation do exist, maybe those already provide a reasonable substitute for an attractive partner, especially if those experiences can be shared with my partner.\nIn my opinion, looking extremely attractive is like training for the Olympics. It's cool that some people work hard at it so that the rest of us can appreciate the fruits of their labor. But most people don't need to be training for the Olympics nor going to great lengths to be beautiful. Of course, even if we don't need to be Olympic athletes, a little bit of exercise is still good, and likewise, very low-effort ways to improve one's appearance are also welcome.\nPersonality\nI'm introverted but also enjoy talking with people when I'm in the mood. If I get along well with someone, I like having long, deep, and intimate discussions. Some of my conversations with friends have gone for 6 or 7 hours. I'm fairly empathetic and usually care about others' emotions. I sometimes try to be funny and tell \"dad jokes\" (though I never want to be an actual dad). I also enjoy self-deprecating humor, though I'm not always joking when I describe my shortcomings. :)\nI'm usually in a pretty good mood and have a positive attitude, despite my \"pessimistic\" negative-utilitarian and antinatalist philosophies. The reason I hold a suffering-focused ethical view is not because I'm unhappy; I think life is sorta fun much of the time. Rather, my reason is that some experiences of intense suffering are so awful and morally salient that everything else seems trivial by comparison.\nI'm attracted to women who are warm, supportive, considerate, funny, and (once we know each other enough) flirty. I try to have all those attributes as well, though I may not necessarily succeed.\nI try to be non-judgmental, though I may disagree with another person's views on something. In cases of conflict, I prefer discussing the problem, seeking to resolve it, and trying to avoid holding grudges. I like this quote: \"Holding a grudge is like holding a hot iron\u2014it hurts you.\"\nI think I get angry less often than average, and when I do have that emotion, I usually express my feelings using words rather than shouting or making insults. I would hope for the same from a partner. I would not be able to live with someone who had a hot temper too often.\nAs problems arise in a relationship, I prefer to hear about them and brainstorm solutions together. Some polite disagreements and concerns from time to time in a generally happy relationship are normal and manageable. However, if non-trivial issues keep arising on a regular basis, I may prefer to give up rather than continue trying to fix them, given that I like being single and don't need a relationship. If a relationship is causing significant distress more often than, say, once every few months in the long run, it seems like more trouble than it's worth. Therefore, I wouldn't be able to provide the level of certainty or commitment that some people might want in a relationship. That said, if the relationship seemed otherwise extremely promising, I'd likely continue trying for a few months or maybe even 1-2 years before throwing in the towel.\nI enjoy exchanging sweet sentiments with a romantic partner, but I'm not interested in the formal romantic holidays like our anniversary, Valentine's Day, birthdays, etc. In general, I don't celebrate holidays. I prefer to do nice things together when the mood arises rather than on a schedule. I also am not very excited by gifts unless the person actually needs the item that would be purchased, and even in that case, instead of receiving a gift I would rather buy the item myself to make sure I'm getting exactly the kind I want. I could pick out the exact item I want on Amazon and send its URL to the other person, but that seems like unnecessary overhead relative to just buying it myself. Instead of gifts, I prefer to show affection by occasionally writing nice messages, making videos, helping with chores, providing reassurance, and so on.\nI dislike surprises (surprise parties, surprise gifts, etc) because I want to plan ahead for things and discuss together whether a proposal makes sense. In general, I prefer life to be calm and predictable rather than \"exciting\". Excitement can come from entertainment rather than real life.\nBeing sugar-hungry and sugar-full\nI find that romantic interaction, such as talking with a girlfriend, feels like eating sugar: it's sweet, pleasant, and somewhat addictive. There are times when I really want sugar, and times when I feel full of it. The same is true for interaction with a girlfriend. I use the word \"sugar-hungry\" to describe those times when I crave romantic interaction and the word \"sugar-full\" to describe times when I'm satiated and don't want more romantic interaction. (I used to name these emotional states based on a specific kind of sugary food, like cake, but I don't want to subconsciously encourage people to eat non-vegan cake because the eggs it contains caused enormous suffering to factory-farmed hens.)\nWhat happens if my and my girlfriend's sugar levels are different at a given time? If one person is hungry to spend time together while the other would rather get work done, what do you do? In my opinion, work is much more important than romantic interaction, since romance is just a fun bonus in life, while altruistic efforts are what really matter. So I think the default should be that if one person wants romantic interaction while the other doesn't, no interaction takes place. Both people should \"swipe right\" (in Tinder lingo) on a given interaction at a given time before it occurs. An exception would be if one person is feeling significantly bad and needs to talk about something right away.\nAn unfortunate aspect of my personality for relationship compatibility is that I tend to get very interested in something for a while and then lose that interest for a while, until getting interested again. In the case of romantic sugar, I sometimes want to binge on it for a while and then fast for several days afterward. This could be pretty annoying to someone who prefers more moderate serving sizes every day. That said, it's plausible that if the other person prevented my sugar binges, then my periods of fasting would also be shorter.\nThe addictiveness of romance can also be a problem if it's tempting and distracts from focus on other things. For this reason, I think I would prefer long periods of talking on an infrequent basis (like once a week), so that during the rest of the time I could get absorbed in my work and non-romance forms of leisure, rather than being distracted by thinking about the next romantic interaction or checking the other person's availability. Unfortunately, because of my erratic waking hours, I wouldn't be able to schedule a fixed time slot for interaction each week. Also, I might randomly be sugar-full or otherwise absorbed into something else when the scheduled interaction would have occurred, which would be unpleasant. Interrupting the flow of meaningful work just to enjoy some fun sugar instead is something I would want to avoid as much as possible.\nSo there are some challenges here, and maybe I find these things more difficult than most people do. But I imagine that enough brainstorming, experimentation, and patience could produce a system for managing different sugar levels that works well enough, as long as the other person also roughly shares my introversion and belief that work is more important than romance.\nAlso, it's plausible that this problem would lessen in the long run once my girlfriend and I got more used to each other, because the tastiness of our sugar might decline. There are several things (foods, TV shows, intellectual topics, etc) that I used to find terribly addictive but now don't because I just got more accustomed to them.\nMonogamy vs polyamory\nWhen I first wrote this dating profile in 2020, one of my criteria for a relationship said: \"monogamous but allowing for viewing/reading porn\". In the following two years, half a dozen people asked me about the reasoning behind my preference for monogamy, with some people suggesting that polyamory could work better given that I don't want to spend a lot of time with my partner. In 2022, I finally updated this profile to say that I would consider either monogamy or polyamory depending on the situation. This section elaborates on my thinking. That said, I know little about the theory of polyamory or what it looks like in practice, so some of what I say may be mistaken.\nHere are my reasons for preferring to have only one partner for myself:\nTime\n: I'm extremely introverted and don't want to spend much time with a partner. One partner is already a big time commitment for me. Having two partners who both expected a nontrivial amount of interaction would be a nightmare.\nLove\n: When I'm in love with someone, the thought of another partner is unappealing. It seems like eating another meal when I'm already full from the first meal.\nJealousy\n: If my partner wanted me to be monogamous, I wouldn't want to make her jealous or hurt by having another partner.\nAnd here are my reasons for wanting my partner to be monogamous:\nSTIs\n: If she was physically intimate with other people (IRL, not just online), then I would worry about STI spreading, and guarding against that would be a big hassle. Of course, if I myself wasn't physically intimate with her IRL, this wouldn't matter.\nLove\n: If I were in love with my partner, I would worry about losing her. If she were romantic with other people, maybe she would become more attached to them over time and want to leave me.\nJealousy\n: I would worry that some of her other partners might not be ok with her being polyamorous. Maybe the time she spent with me would make them unhappy, even if they claimed to be fine with it.\nSince these are currently my main hesitations about polyamory, in cases where they wouldn't apply, I would be open to trying polyamory.\nPolyamory for myself\nI would consider two partners for myself in a situation where the time spent with each person wouldn't exceed 1-2 hours per week on average, where I wasn't deeply in love with any person enough to not want another partner, and where neither partner would be made jealous.\nIf I lived with a partner in person, I plausibly wouldn't have time for any other partner because living together requires a decent amount of in-person interaction, and plausibly my introvert brain would already feel enough social stimulation from that to not want more. Also, because of STI concerns, I plausibly wouldn't want to do IRL sexual activity with anyone except a primary partner who herself was monogamous. However, online sexual interaction with other people wouldn't be ruled out.\n(Another argument against IRL sex in a long-distance relationship is that traveling would squish bugs and harm animals in other ways, and I'd feel guilty about causing that harm without a good reason.)\nA main possible advantage of polyamory would be that I might be less bothered by the incompatibilities of any given partner. If I have to choose just one partner, there's a lot of pressure to make the perfect choice, but no partner is ever perfect.\nOne situation where people often use polyamory is if a main partner has low sex drive. This main partner (often a woman) might encourage her boyfriend/husband to get sex elsewhere. I'm unsure if I would be happy with an arrangement of that sort, because for me, a main point of sexual interaction is to feel intimate with someone I love and to increase romantic attraction. If I just wanted an orgasm, I could masturbate on my own. In evolutionary terms, it doesn't make sense for a man to have romantic feelings toward a woman whom he never has sex with, because she won't bear his children, so at best she would be one more friend. I suppose there are some exceptions to this evolutionary claim, such as if a woman could help the man raise kids from a previous relationship. Also, the predictions of armchair evolutionary psychology aren't necessarily true in the real world, though I think it is true that many men require an expectation of eventually having some amount of sexual activity in order to feel significant romantic interest in someone. In any case, there are many couples where having sex outside the relationship makes things work for them, which is great.\nPolyamory for my partner\nI would be open to a polyamourous partner if STIs weren't a concern, if I wasn't so in love with her that I worried about losing her, and if all of her other partners were genuinely ok with her being polyamourous rather than just grudgingly accepting of it.\nSTIs would not be a concern either if I was never physically intimate IRL with her, or if she wasn't physically intimate with anyone besides me IRL. In theory if there was a third person who was also STI-paranoid, it might work for her to have two IRL partners, but I would worry about making things complicated, and we would have to deeply trust the honesty of everyone involved. In any case, I don't live near enough like-minded people for it to be likely that there would even be multiple IRL partners.\nThe possibility of jealousy felt by her other partners is a main hesitation of mine, since I would feel guilty unless everyone involved was enthusiastically consenting to the arrangement. That said, I imagine there are some people who are enthusiastic enough about polyamory to allay this worry.\nThe main benefit of having a polyamorous partner would be that I wouldn't be the only person responsible for her romantic needs, and I could spend less time on the relationship than most monogamous women would prefer.\nAcknowledgements\nParts of this page were inspired by discussions about compatibility with a girlfriend during summer 2020.
